270 nomen.

Though hs should hamper with a wicked cause
The juster party, and insult the lava.
Des ise the citizen of better lise,
If c ogg’d with children, or a fruitsul wife. 50
Accost him thus, (for he with rapture hears
A title tingling in his tendet earS,)
Quintus, or PubliuS, on my saith depend‚
Your own deserts have render'd me your friend:
I know the mazy doubles of the laws‚ 55
Untie their knotS, and plead with vast applause.
Had you a nut, the villain might as well
Pluck out my eyes, as rob you of the shell.
This is the business of my life profess‘d‚
That you lose nothing, or become a jest. 60
Bid him go home, of his sweet sels take care ς
Conduct his cause, proceed‚ and persevere,
Should the red dogstar infant statues split,
Or sat-paunch’d Furius in poetic fit
Bombastic howl; and, while the tempest blovm, 65
Bespawl the wintry Alps with hoary snows.
Some person then, who happens to be nigh,
Shall pull your client by the sleeve‚ and cry,
‘ See with what patience he pursues your ends!
Was ever man so active sor his friends 3” 70
Thus gudgeons daily shall swim in apace‚
And stock your fish-ponds with a fresh increase.
This lcsson also well deserves your care,
Is any man should have a sickly heir,
And large estate, lest you yoursels betray ⁷5
By making none but bachelors your prey,
With winning ease the pleasing bane instil,
[n hopes to stand the second in his will;
Then is the boy by some disaster hurl'd,
Should take his Journey to the nether world, 80

53 A slave was no sooner made free than he ualified himself
with a sumame, such as Marcus Quintus Pub ius‚⁸ which car-
ried a sort of dignity w1th it. The Romans saluted each other
by their surnames.
