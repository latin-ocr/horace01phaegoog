Boon 1.-—om·: VI. 25

Thus amiable and kind3 1⁵
He fondly hopeS‚ that you shall prove

'rbus ever vacant to his love,
Nor heeds the fajthless wind.

Unhappy they, to whom untried

You shine‚ alas! in beauty's pride3 20
While 1, now safe on shore,

Will consecrate the pictured storm,

And all my grateful vows perform
To Ν eptune's saving power.

ODE VL-To AGRIPPA.

Hauon describes his genius as fitter for amorous subjectu, then ,
to celebrate the exploits of heroes.

mes, who soars on Homer's wing‚

Agrippa, shall thy conquests sing,

Whate’er‚ inspired by his command,

The soldier dared on sea or land. ·
But we nor tempt with feeble art “ 5

Achilles’ unrelenting heart,

Nor sage Ulysses in our lays

Pursues his wanderings through the seam

Nor ours in tragic stralus to teu

How Pelops’ cruel offspring fell. 10
The muse who rules th’ unwarlike lyre

Forbids me boldly to aspiro

To thine or sacred Caesar’s fame,

And hurt with feeble song the theme.
Who can describe the god of fight 15

In adamantine armour might, x

Or Merion on the Trojan shore ’

With (lust, how glorious! eover'd o’er‚

Or Diomed, by Pallas' aid,

To warring gods an equal made3 20
