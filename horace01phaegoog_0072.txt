ΒΟ nomos.

Like Saliari priests the dance we’ll lead, 15

And many a mazy measure tread.

Now let the Thracian goblet foam,

Nor in the breathless draught o'ercome

Shall Bassus yield his boasted name

To Damalis», os tippling same. 90
Here let the rose and lilly shed

Their short-lived bloom3 let parsley spread

Its living verdure o'er the feast,

And crown with mingled sweets the guest.

On Damalis each amorous boy 25

Shall gaze with eyes that fiow with Joy,

While she, as curls the ivy lant,

shall twine luxuriant round er new gallant.

18 This signifies a custom among the Thi-scians of drinking
a certain measure df wine without closing the lips or taking

bmzzthfftfflgient Romans had such an abhorrence of a woman’s

drinking to excess, that the laws of the twelve tablelsipermitted
a husband to punish his Wife with death who was g ty of that

crima—San.

26 The eye, by excess of wine, is 10ωο and flowing, or almost
dissolved and broken. As love has the same effect, Anacreon
desires a painter to draw the eyes of his mistress, like thom of
Venus, ‘⁸ flowing in moisture.”— Tur-ner.

ODE XXXVIl.-TO HIS COMPANIONSJ·

Houor: exhorta his companions to rejoice on account of
Cleopatra’s death. .

Now let the bowl with wine be crown'd‚

Now lighter danee the mazy round,

And let the sacred eouch be stored
With the rich dainties of a priestly board.

ὓ The death of Cleopatra put an end to the war between Oe·
uvius and antony. · Horace compossd six odes on this subject,
and although this be the last, yet it is not the least bunum.
