(When dreams, they say, are true) Rome's somdor
rose,

And awsul spake: ‘⁸ You may as well proposo
To carry timber to a wood, as th‘rong

' The crowded writers of the Grecian song.”

I3et swelling Furius on th’ affrighted stage 4⁶
Mur-der poor Memnon, or in muddy rage
Describe the head os Rhine; in idle vein
1 write, what never shall presumo to gain
The prize, where Metius high in judgment sits
To hear the labours of contending wits: 50
Or where the people with applauding hands
The well-wrought scene repeatedly demands.

Os all mankind, in light and easy vein
Fundanius best can paint the comio scene,
The wily harlot, and the slave who Join ³⁶
To wipe the miser of hi‘s darling coin.
Pollio in pure iambio numbers sin s
The tragic ‹le-eds os heroes andps ings; 't
While Varius in sublime and a'rdent vein ⁸
Supports the grandeur of the epie-strain. σθ
On Virgil all the rural musds sutile,
smooth flow his lino& and elegant hisptyle. ·
Satire alone remain’d, no easy stt-ain, -
Which Varro, and some othere, tried in vain,
While Ι, tha ‚ some slight success may claim, 0⁶
Though ffij erior to th’ inventor’s same:
Nor from h1s head shall Ι presume to tear
'rhat sacred wreath, he well deser-ves to wear.

I said, his vers'e in muddy rapture fiows,
And more his error-s than his beauties shows 3 70
But, prithee, you that boast a critio's name,
Don’t you sometimes the mighty Homer blame ἒ
Does not Luciliu& though of gentle strain,
Correct even Armine, and reform his scene?
And in his pleasantry old Ennius rate, 75
When his dull lines want dignity and weight'!
Yet when he speaks of his own right to same,
Confesses frankly their superior claim.
