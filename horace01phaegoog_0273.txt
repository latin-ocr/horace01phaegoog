Should a man take alambkin in his chair,
With sondling names caress the spotless fair;
clothes, maidS, and gold, as for his child, provide,
And a stout husband sor the lovely bride,
His civil rights the Judge would take away, 305
And to trustees in guardianship convey.
Then sure you will not call him sound of brain,
By whom his daughter sor a lamb w'as slain.
Folly and guilt are madness in th' extreme ;
'I'he impious and the mad eternally the same. 310
Blood-stain’d Bellona thunders round his head,
Who is by glassy same a captive led.

Now try the sons of luxury, you’ll find
Right reason proves them sools of madding kind.
A youth, upon his father’s death, receives 315
A thousand talentS‚ and his orders gives
That all the trades os elegance and taste,
All who with wit and humour joy a feast,
The impious crowd, that fills the Tuscan street,
Early next morning at his house should meet. 320
What theni They frequent his command obey'd,
And thus his speech the wily pander made :
“ Whate’er these people have: whate'er is mine ς
'Po-day, to-morrow send, be sure is thine.”

Hear the just youth this generous answer make:
“ In clumsy boots‚ dear hunter, sor my sake, 326
You sleep in wild Lucania’s snowy waste,
That I at night on a whole boar may feast.
For fish you boldly sweep the wintry seaS,
That Ι, unworthy, may enjoy my ease. 330
Let each five hundred pounds‚ with pleasure, take,
'ro thee, dear pander‚ 1 a present make
Of twice a thousand, that with all her charms
Your wife at night may run into my arm8.”

An actor’s son dissolved a wealthy pearl 335

A thousand solid talents at a draught.
