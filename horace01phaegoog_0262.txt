Sweets, turn’d to choler, with cold phlegm engage‚
And civil war in the rack'd stomach wage.

Behold how pale the sated guests arise
From suppers‚ puzzled with varieties!

The body ton, with yesterday’s excess 105 -
Burden'd and tired, shall the pure soul depress;
Weigh down this portion of celestial birth,

This breath of god, and fix it to the earth.

Who down to sleep from a short supper lies,

Can to the next day's business vigorous rise, 110
Οι· jovial wander (when the circling year

Brings back some festal day) to better eheer3

Οι- when his wasted strength he would restore,
When years approach, and age's feeble hour

A soster treatment claim. But is in prime ,115
of youth and health you take before your time

The luxuries os life, where is their aid

When age or sickness shall your strength invade'!

· Our⁴sathers loved (and yet they had a nose) ³

A tainted bean but I believe they chose 120
The mouldy &agments with-a friend to eat,

Rather than eat it whole themselves, and sweet.
Oh! that the earth, when vigorous and young,

aad borne me this heroic raee among! ·

Do you the voice of same with pleasure hear! 125
(Sweeter than verse it chartus the humanear 3)
Behold, what infomy and ruin rise ,

From a large dish, where the la turbot lies;
Your friends, your neighbourS, l your solly hate,
You h'ate yoursels, in vain, and cui-se your fate, 130

‚ When, though you wish for· death, you want the pelf

To purchase even a rope to hang ¹ourself. .
“ These precepts well may wretc ed Trausius rate ;

the language of Plato, who says that it is a portion of the uni·
