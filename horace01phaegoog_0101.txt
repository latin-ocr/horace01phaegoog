Boon 11.—-on1: xvm. 80

whether fair Libra’s kinder sign,
Or Scorpius with an eye malign 20
Beheld my birth, (whose gloomy power,
Rules dreadsul o’er the natal hour‚)
Or Capricorn‚ with angry γεγε,
Who shines the tyrant of the seam
With equal beams our stare unite, 25
And strangely shed their mingled light.
Thee, Jove's bright influenee snatch’d away
From balesul Satum’s impious ray,
And stopp’d the rapid wings os fate
'When the full theatre‚ elate, 30
With joysul transports hail’d thy name,
And thrice uprais’d the loud acclaim,
A tree‚ when falling on my head,
Had surely crush'd me to the dead;
But Pan, the meve-guardian, broke 35
With saving hand the destined stroke.
For thee, let the rich victim's blood
Pour forth to Jove its purple fiood3
For thee, the votive temple rise3
For me, an humble lambkin dies. 40

ODE XVIII.
Houor: inveighs against Roman luxury andcovetonsneen.

No waIIS, with ivory inlaid‚

Adorn my house; no colonnade

Proudly supports my citron beamS, -

Nor rich with gold my ceiling flames;

Nor have 1, like an heir unknown, 5
Seized upon Attalus's throne ;

Nor dames», to happier fortunes bred‚

Draw down sor me the purple thread

Yet with a firm and honest beart,

Unknowing or os fraud or art, ιο
Α liberal vein os genius bless'd‚

l'm by the rich and ἆξαι caress’d.
