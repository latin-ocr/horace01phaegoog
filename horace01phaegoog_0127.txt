3001: ιιι-ουκ x. κ 115
H. Now Chloe reigns; her voice and lyre

Melt down the soul to sost desire, 1⁰ ἰ

Nor will 1 sear e’en death, to save
Her dearer beauties from the grave. ·
L. My heart young Calais inspires,
Whose bosom glows with mutual fires,
For whom I twice would die with joy, 15
If death would spate the charming boy.
H. Yet what is love, whose bands we breite,
Again should tame us to the yoke3
Should I shake off bright Chloe's chain,
And take my Lydia home agaim 2⁰
L. Though he exceed in beauty far
The rising lustre os a star;
Though light as cork thy fancy strays,
Thy passione wild as angry seas,
When vex’d with storms3 yet gladly 1 25
With thee would live, with thee would die.

11 According to the superstition of the audente, who believed
that the death os one person might be prevented by that of an
other. From hence came the custom of those devotements,
made for the lives of rinces.

20 Horace was wilfing to try whether L dia would eonaeht
to a reeoncihation ; but, to avoid a refusal, e leaves the sense
unfinished, and rather insinuates than expresses his own incli-
nation; or perhaps the break is owing to the warmth of Lydia,
who interrupte hun, and prevents what he is going to say.

ODE X.-·TO LYCE.
Houor implore3‚Ly<-:e td· take pity on him.

. Tuom you drank the deep stream os Tanais icy,
The wife os some barbarous bloekhead, oh, Lyce,
Yet your heart might relent to expose me reclined
At your cruel shut door to the rege os the wind.
Hark! your gate-how it creaks! how the grove,

planted round 5
Yon beautiful villa, rebellows the sound!
