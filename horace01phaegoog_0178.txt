Of her, os her what now remains,
Who breathed the loves, who eharm’d theswain&
And snatch’d me from my beart}

Once happy maid! in pleasing gustes, 26
Who vied with Cynara in smile8‚
Ah! tragical survival!
She glorious died in beauty's bloom‚
While cruel fate defers thy doom
To be the raven's rival. 30

'rhat youths, in servent wishes bold,

Not without laughter may behold
A torch‚ whose early fite

Could every breast with love inflame,

,Now saintly spread a sickly glemu, 35
And in a smoke expire.
