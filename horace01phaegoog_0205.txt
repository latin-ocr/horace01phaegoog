How long} What ransom shall 1 pay}
Speak-—I the stern command obey.
'ro e iate the guilty deod,
Say, {fian a hundred bullooks bleed3 50
Or shall I to the lying string
Thy fame and spotless virtue sing?
Teach thee, a golden star, to rise,
And deathless walk the span led skiesss
When Helen’s virtue was osmod, 55
Her brothers, though with rage bnfiamed‚
Yet to the hard his eyes restored,
When suppliant he their grace implored.
Oh! calm this madness of my hrain,
For you can heal this raging pain. 60
You never knew the birth of emme,
Nor by thy hand, all-skilful dame,
The poor man's ashes are upturn'd‚
Though they be thrice three days inuru’d.
Thy bosom’s bounteous and humane, - 65
Thy hand from blood and murder cleanz
And with a blooming raoe of boys
Lucina orowns thy mother-joys.

CANIDIA’S ANSWER.

I‘m. hear no more. Thy prayers are vain:

Not rocks, amid the wint main,

Less heed the shipwreck’ sailor’s ories,

When Neptune b1ds the tempest riso.
