a tendency to make the reader satisfied with him-
self and otherS, and to produce on his part a con·
duct at once conciliatory towards the world, and
consistent with his own independence and integ·

rity. He has this advantage over the rigid Juvenal ⁸

—that we receive him into our bosom8‚ while he
reasons with good-humour, and corrects in the lan-
guage of friendship. Νοι· will his satit-es be less
useful to the present age than to that in which they
were written3 since he does not draw his charac-
ters from particular persona, but from human nature
itsels‚ which is invariably the same in all ages and
countries.

Horace has left us in his writings complete ma·
terials for his own biography ; εηάςᾈίε life was so
entirely passed with Augustus», Μᾴοξιηειε, and the
poets his contemporaries, that its history is in itself
the best commentary on the literary transactione
of that brilliant period. He is, perhaps, the best
historian also of his country’s poetry: his sketche8‚
it is true, are concise and incidental; but the out·
line is unbroken, and we have good reason to be-
lieve that it is correct. ,ω

Horace was buried next to the tomb of Mecknasn

at txlsie θὶίιτεηὲῑγ of the Esquiline hill.
