Boon 11.-om.=: xr. ’ 70

'Ihe man, within the golden mean, 5
Who can his boldest wish contain,
Securely views the ruin’d cell,
Where sordid want, and sorrow dwell,
And in himself serenelygreat, ·
Declines an envied room of state. 10
When high in air the pine assentis,
To every ruder blast it bends.
The palace falls with heavier tveight,
When tumbling from its airy height ς
And when from heaven the lightning flies, 15
It blasts the hills that proudest rise,
Whoe’er enjoys th' untroubled breast,
With virtue’s tranquil wisdom bless’d‚
With hope the gloomy hour ean cheer,
And temper happiness with sear. 20
11· Jove the winter’s horrore bring,
Yet Jove restores the genial spring.
Then let us not of fate complain,
For soon shall change the gloomy scene.
Apollo sometiines can insprre 25
The silent muse, and wake the lyre:
The deathsul bow not always plies,
'rh’ u'nerring dart not always flies.
When fortune, various goddess, lowers,
Colleot your strength, exert our powers ς 30
But when she breathes a kinger gale,
Be wise, and furl your swelling sail.
