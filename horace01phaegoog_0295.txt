No, you with ardour to the danger run,

And dare a second time to be undone.

Repeated slave! What beast, that breaks his chain,
In love with bondage would return again'!

But you, it seemS, ne'er touch the wedded dame—
Then‚ by the son of Jove, 1 here disclaim 76
The name of thies, when, though with backward eye
1 wisely pass the silver goblet by.

But take the danger and the shame away,
And vagraut nature bounds upon her prey, 80
Spurning the teins, But say, shall you pretend
O’er me to lord it, who can vilely bend
To each roud master3 to each changing hour
A very s avet Not even the pretor’s power,
With thrice-repeated riteS‚ thy fears control, 85
Or vindicate the freedom of thy soul.
But as the slave, who lords it o’er the rest.
Is still a slave, a master slave at best,
So art thou, insolent‚ by me obey’d3
Thou thing os wood and wireS, by others play'd. 90
Η. Who then is free! D. The wise, who well
maintains
An empire o'er himself: whom neither enaim,
Nor want, nor death, with slavish sear inspire,
Who boldly answers to his warm desire, ·

. Who can ambition’s vainestgss'ts despise, 95

Firm in himself who on himself relie8‚
Polish’d and round, who runs his proper course,
And breaks missortune with superior soree.
What is there here that you can justly claim,
Or eall your own? When an imperious dame 100
Demands her price, with insults vile pursues thee;
Driven out of doors, with water well bedews thee,
Then calls you back ; for shame‚ shake off her ehain,
And boldly tell her you are free. In vain ;
A tyrant-lord thy better will restrainS, 105
And spurs thee hard, and breaks thee to his reinS.
Is some samed piece the painter’s art displayS,
Transfix’d you stand, with admiration μιᾶς
