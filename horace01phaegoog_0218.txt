Who turns the soil, and o'er the ploughshare beuds ;
He, who adulterates the laws, and veuds3
The soldier, and th’ adventui-ers os the main,
Profess their various labours they sustain,
A decent competence for age to raise, 36
And then retire to indolence and ease. ,

Miser. For thus the little ant (to human lore
No mean example) forms her frugal store,
Gather’d with mighty toil, on every side,

Nor ignorant, nor careless to provide 40
For ssuture want— Horace. Yet when the stars
appear,

That darkly sadden the declining year,

No more she comes abroad, but wisely lives

On the fair store industrious summer gives.

For thee, nor summer’s beat, nor winter’s cold, 45

Fire, sea, nor sword, stop thy pursuit of gold;

Nothing can break th' adventurouS, bold design,

So none possess a larger sum than thine.

But, prithce, whence the pleasure, thus by stealth

Dexi> in the earth to hide thy weight of wealth'! 50

. One sarthing lessen’d, you the mass reduce.
H. And if not lessen'd, whence can rise its use‘!

What though you thresh a thousand sacks os grain,

No more than mine thy stomach can contain.

The slave, who bears the load of bread, shall eat 55

No more than he who never selt the weight.

Or say, what difference, is we live confined

within the bounds by nature's laws assign’d,

Whether a thousand acres of demam,

Or one poor hundred, yield sufficient grain? 60
M. Oh! but ’tis sweet to take stom lai-ger hom-ds.
H. Yet, is my little heap as much affords,

Why shall your granaries be valued more

Thau my small hampers‚ with their frugal stoi-03
You want a cask of water, or would fill 65

An ample goblet; whence the sroward will

To choose a mighty river’s rapid course,

Before this little fountain’s lenient source3
