Nor Erimus, of inhospitable strain3
Nor quiver'd Scythians3 nor the Caspian maim

26 The poet here collects three facts, to show that the gods
'cularl watched over his preservation. He fied from the
effic of &filippi in 7123 he escaped being hilled by the fau
of aueo, 734 ; and he was preserved from shnpwreck, robsbly
in the year 7J6, wheu he went aboard the fleet with nfaeceuas,
to pass over mto Sicily against Pompey. He never mentum·
any dan r of shipwreck to which he hed been exposed in his
retum Phihppi, as Acron aud some commentatore have
imagined‚ who suppose him wandering, with a tedious and un·
certain voyage through the Sicilian seas, instead of going di·
rectly to Brundusium.. Resides, such a voyage must hare beeu
as dan rous as tedlous; those sess belng covered wrth the
fleets o Pompey and Domitius, to whom he was at that time

believed that the Britons sacrificed strangers to the gods3 and
Torrentius tells us that in his time they were rather malevolent
than cruel to soi-sighere, but that such a disposition must be ex-
pected in a people separated from the whole world.

Mt. Baxter very dexterously applies these human sacrifices
tothe Irish; of whom the character he tells us is better to be
understood, and gives this excellent reason for his decision ι
that St. somne-(abone three hundred years aster this ode was
written) saw two Iri-nmen devouring a human carcass ιη

Gaul.
