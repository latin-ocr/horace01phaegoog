BOOK ιι.- —oms-¹ 1. 65

, Yet unatoned (a labour vast! 15
Doubtsul the die, and dire the cast !)
You treat adventurouS, and incautious tread
On fires, with faithless embers overspread:

Retard a while thy glowing vein,
Nor swell the solemn, tragic scene; 20
And when thy enge, historic cares
Have form’d the train of Rome’s affairs,
With losty rapture reinflamed‚ infuse
Heroic thoughts, and wake the buskin'd muse.

Hark! the shrill clarion's voice 1 hear; 25

Its threatening murmure pierce mine ea1·;

And in thy lines, with brazen breath,

The trumpet sounds the charge of deathz
While the stron splendours of the sword affright
The flying stee , and mar the rider’s sight! 30

Panting with terror, I survey

The martial host in dread array;

'Phe chiese, how valiant and how just!

Defiled with not inglorious duat,
And all the world in chaine, but Cato, see 3⁵
of spirit unsubdued‚·and dying to be free.

Imperial J unc, fraught with ire,

And all the partial gods os Tyre,

Who‚ seeble to revengc her crieS,

Retreated to their native skieS, 40
Have in the vietor's bleeding race repaid
J ugurtha’s ruin, and appeased his shade.

35 Au the praisee which this republican hero hae received
from different authors are not equal to thie ein le character, that
Cesar found it eaeier to subdue the whole wor than the inflex
ible spirit of Cata-Bona. F
