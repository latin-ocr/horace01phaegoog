Nor shall azure Thetis more 3⁵
Waft thee to thy natal shore;

Then let j0y and mirth be thine‚

Mirthful songs and joyous wine,

And with converse blithe and gay

Drive all gloomy cares nway. 40

ODE XV.—To NEAERA.

Horum: complains of Neaera’s breach of saith.

Ouum was the night, the face of heaven serene,

Bright shone the moon amid her starry train,

- When round my neck as curls the tendril-vine—

what, as I dictated‚ you bo dly swore:

While the gaunt wolf pursues the trembling sheep3

While fierce Orion harrows up the deep3

While Phoebus' locks float wauton in the wind,

Thus shall Neaera prove, thus ever kind. 10
But, if with aught of man was Horace born,

Severely shalt thou feel his honest scorn,

Nor will he tamely bear the bold delight

With which his rival riots out the night,

But in his anger seek some kinder dame, 15

Warm with the rapturos of a mutual flame3

Nor shall thy rage, thy grief, or angry charius,

Recall the lover to thy faithless arms.

And thou, whoe’er thou art, who joy to shine,

Proud as thou art, in spoils which once were mine, 20

Though wide thy land extends, and large thy sold,

Though rivers roll for thee their purest gold,

Though nature’s wisdom in her works were thino,

And beauties of the human face divine,

Yet soon thy ride her wandering love shall mcum, 25

While-l sh laugh, exulting in my turn.
