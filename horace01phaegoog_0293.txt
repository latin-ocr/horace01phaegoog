SATIRE VII.

Ome of horme’s slaves. making use of the freedom allowed at
the Saturnalia, rates his master in 3 droll and severe manner.

Davus. I’u. hear no more, and with impatience burn,
Slave as 1 am, to answer in my turn3
And yet I fear— Horace. What! DavuS, is it you'!

D. Yes. Davu8‚ sir, the faithful and the true.
With wit enough no sudden death to fear— 5

H. Well, since this jovial season os the year
Permits it, and our ancestors ordain.

No more thy dear impertinence restrain.

D. Among mankind‚while some with steady view
One constant course of darling vice pursue, 10
Most others float along the changing tide,

And now to virtue, now to vice they glide.
Lo! from three rings how Priscus plays the light;
Now shows his naked hand--the various wight
With every hour a different habit wears: 15
Now in a palace haughtily appearS‚
Then hides him in some vile and filthy place,
Where a clean slave would blush to show his sace.
Now takes at home, and now to Athens flies;
Intensely studies with the learn’d and wise. 20
Sure all the godS‚ who rule this varying earth,

' ln deep despite presided at his birth.

Old Volaneriu8‚ once that man of joke, ‘

'When the just gout his crippled fingers broke,
Maintain’d a slave to gather up the dice, 25
So constant was he to his dai-ling vice.

Yet less a wretoh than he, who now maintains

A steady course, now drives with looser mins,

H. 'rell me, thou tedious varlet‚ whither tends '
This putrid stuff‘! D. At you direct it bends. 30

H. At ine, you sooundrel'! D. When with lavish

praise
You vaunt the happiness os ancient days,
