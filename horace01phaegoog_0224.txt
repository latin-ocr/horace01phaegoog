He tease us with his mere impertinenee,
We cry, the creature wants even common sense. 90

, Alas! what law-s, of ho'w severe a sti-ain,

Against oin-salves we thoughtlessly ordain‘!
For we 113ὑο all om: vices, and the best
Is he who with the fewest is oppress'd.
A kinderftiend‚ who balanees my good 95
And bad together, as intruth he should,
If hapl my od qualities prevail‚
Incline indu gent *to the sinking 30310.
For like'influlgenee let his errors plead‚
His merit-s be with 'equeb measure weigh’d3 100
For 110, who hopes his bile shall not offend‚
Should oven-look tho pimplesnf his friend;
And eve1'1 in jtutieo ‚to his own deseets,
At least should grant the pardon he expects.
But, since we never from the breast os sools 10‘5
Can root their passibus, yet, while reason ruleS,
Let it hold forth its 003103 with equal hand,
Justly to punish, 333110 crimes demand.
If a poor slave, who takes awayyour plate,
Liek the warm sauce, dt half-eoldfragments eat, 110
Yet should you crucisy the wretch, we swear
Not Labeo's madness can with yours compare.
Is the crime 1033, or less the want of sense,
Thus to resent a trivial, slight offence!
Forgive the man you loved, or you'll appear 115
Of joyless kind, ill-natureyd and severe ;
Yet you detest· hffmg and with horror shun‚
As debtors from th· ruthless Ruso run,
Who damna the wretches on th' appointed day
His interest or principal to pay, 120
01· 0130, like captives, stretch the listening 031·
Η13 tedious tales of history to hear.
A friend has soui'd my coueh: ,3111 deep disgraee!
Or off the ‘table thrown some,higl1-wrought vase; .
