ODE XXIL—TO ARISTIUS FUSCUSst·

'Phe poet attributes the preservation of his life to conscious
innocence and Lalage’s favour.

Tm: man, who knows not guilty sear,

Nor wants the bow, nor pointed spear3

Nor needS, while innocent os beart,
The quiver‚ teeming with the poison’d dart3

Whether through Libya’s burning sands 5
His journey leadS, or Scythia’s lande,
Inhospitable waste os suosve,

Or where the fabulous Hydaspes fiows:

For musin on my lovely maid,
While careqess in the woods Ι stray’d, 10
Α wolf—how dreadsul! cross’d my way,

Yet fied—he fied from his desenceless prey:

N o beast os such portentous size

In warlike Daunia’s foreste lies; ,

Νοι· such the tawny lion reigns 15
Fierce on his native Afric’s thirsty plaius.

ὓ Although the poet seems to have been in love with Lala ,
yet he had too much friendship for Aristius to be his rivaL e

therefore begins this ode with a profession os his innocence, and

integrity of manners, to convince Aristius that he ought not to
be jealous even while he is praising his mistress—Dae.

l The first cause, to which the poet attributes his preserva-
tion‚ is the innocence and integrity of his life; and he is of too
careless and unaffected a character to be, suspected of insin-
cerity‚ whatever were his Epicurean principles. With the
ἔξω speculative opinions, a man may be morally honest and

uous.

4 The Africans were obliged to poison their arrows to defend
them from the wild beasts with which their country was in·

tentati. This poison wasa mixture of ἤρα’. and human blood,
and Pliny tells us it was mcursblee-Daeo. .
