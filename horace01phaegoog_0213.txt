‘rna sucum rosn- , 201·

The prince‚ who owes to beauty’s ueen his birth,
Who bids the snowy victim's b ood
Pour forth to-day its purple nond,

Oh! may he glorious rule the conquer’d earth! 175
But yet a milder glory show
In mercy to the prostrate foe.

Already the fierce Mede his arms revereS,

Which wide extend th’ imperial sway,

And bid th' unwilling world obey; 180
The haughty Indian owns his scats,

And Scythiam, doubtful of their doom,

Await the dread resolves of Rome.

Faith‚ Honour‚ Peace‚ celestial maid,
And Modesty‚ in ancient guise array’d, 185
And Virtue (with unhallow’d scorn
Too long neglected) now appear,
While Plenty fills her bounteous horn, ¹
And pours her blessings o’er the various year.

ORORUS OF Yourns.

If the prophetie power divine, 190
Famed for the golden bow and quiver'd dart,
Who knows to charm the listening N ine,
And feeble mortals raise with healing art;
lf he with gracious eye surve the towers,
Where Rome his deity a ores, 195
Oh ἒ let each era still presage
Increase of happiness from age to age!

CHORUS OF vinem&

Oh ! may Diana, on these favourite hius
Whose diffusive presence fills
Her hallow’d sane, 200
Propitious deign
Our holy priests to hear,
And to our youth incline her willing ear!
