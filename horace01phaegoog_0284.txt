’Tis good to take these outworks to his pels,

But best to storm the citadel itself. q120

Writes he vile verses in a frantie vein!
Augment his madneSS, and approve the strain:
Loves he a lassl then, with cheersul glee
Give to his arms your own Penelope.
‚ U. Can you suppose a dame so chaste, so pure,

Gould e'er be tempted to the guilty lure, 126

Whom all the suitors amorously strove,
In vain, to stagger in her plighted lovel

T. The youth too sparing of their presente came ς
They loved the banquet rather than the dame; 130
'And thus your prudent, honourable sponse,
It seemS, was faithful to her nuptial voWS.
But had she once indulged the dotard’s glee
Smack'd her old cull, and shared the spoil with thee,
She never aster could be terrified, 135
Sagacious beagle‚ from the reeking hide.

I’ll tell a tale, well worthy to be told,
A fact that happen'd‚ and I then was old:
A hag at ThebeS, a wicked one, no doubt,
Was thuS, according to her will, lugg’d out, 140
Stiff to the pile. Upon his naked back
Her heir sustain’d the well anointed pack.
She, likely, took this crotchet in her head,
That she might slip, if possible, when dead,
From him, who trudging through a filthy read, 145
Had stuck too closely to the living load.

Be cautiouS, therefore, and advance with art,
Nor sink beneath, nor overact your part.
A noisy sellow must of course offend
'Phe surly temper of a sullen friend: 150
Yet be not mute—like Davus in the play,
With head inclined, his awful nod obey‚
Creep into favour: if a ruler gale
Assault his face, admonish him to veil
His precious pate. Oppose your shoulders, proud 155
To disengage him from the l·ustling crowd.
