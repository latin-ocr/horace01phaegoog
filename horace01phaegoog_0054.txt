ODE xlx-GN GLYCERA.

Homo: acknowledges that he in inflamed with the love οἰ

Glycera.

Venus, who gave the Cupide birth,
And the resistless god of wine,
With the ay power of wauton mirth,
Now bigy my heart its peace ιεείειι,
Agaiu sor Glycera 1 burn,
And all my long· forgotten flames return.

Like Parian marble, pure and might,
The shining maid, my bosom warme.
Her sace, too dazzling for the sight,
Her sweet coqueting-how it charmei
Whole Venus rushing through my veina,
No longer ιιι her favourite Cyprus reign83

No long er suffers me to write
Of Sc thiam, fierce in martial deed3

Or Part ian, urging in hie ssight
The battle with reverted steed3
Such themee she will no more ap rove
Nor aught that sounds impertinent to ove.

Here let the living altar rise
Adorn' d with every herb and fiower⁹
Here fleme the incense to the altien,
And purest wine’ s libation pour;
Due honours to the goddess d,
Son siuks ω wining loveg the yie ding' maid.
