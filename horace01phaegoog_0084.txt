When its floating lustro playn

Nor the Cnidiam sair and young,

Who, the virgin choir among,

Might deceive, in female guise,

Strangers, though extremely wiso, 3⁰
With the difference between

And his hair of flowing grace,

And his boyish‚ girlish sace.

ODE VL—'ro SEPTIMUS.
Houor. invites Septimius to reside in the coumry with him.

Afford a kind and calm reti-ean

The Greciane fix’d their blissful βοαῖς 10 .

There may my labours end, my wandering's cenae,
There all my toils of wei-fare rest in peace.
