With youth unfading shall impr-ove,
While to th’ immor-tal fane of Jove
The vestal maidS, in silent state
Amandum, on the pontiff wait-

With rapid course and deas ’ning πανοῦ 1⁸
Where Aufidus impetuous raven, ‘
And where a or, enervate stream
From banieh' Daunus takes its name,

O’er warlike realms who fix’d his throne,
Shall Horace, deathlese hard, be known, 20
Who first attempted to inspiro

With Grecian eouude the Roman lyre.

With conscious pride, oh muse divine!
Assume the honours ‚iustly thine:

With laurel wreaths my head eui-round,

Such as the god of verse have crown’d. 25
