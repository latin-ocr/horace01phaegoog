What would thy madneSS‚ thus with stoi-ms to sport 2
Cast firm your anchor in the friendly port.

Behold thy naked decks: the wounded mast 5
And sail·yards groan beneath the southern blast‚
Nor without ropes thy keel can longer brave

The rushing fury of th’ imperious wave ε

Torn are thy saiIs, thy guardian gods are lost,
Whom you might call in future tempests toss'd. io
What though majestic in your pride you stood

A noble daughter os the Pontic wood‚

Yon now may vainly boast an empty name,

Or birth conspicuous in the rolls os fame.

'I'he manner, when stoi-ms around him fise, 15
N o longer on 'a painted stern relies.

Ah! yet take heed‚ lest these new tempests sweep
In sportive rage thy glories to the deep.

Thou late my deep anxiety and sear,

And now my fond desire and tender care, 20
Ah! yet take heed‚ avoid these fatal seas,

'rhat roll among the shining Cyclades.
