SATIRE vll.
Houor. humorously descriffisggguabble between Rupilius and

How mongrel Persius in his·wrathful mood

That outlaw’d wretch, Rupilius King, pursued

With poisonous filth, and venem all his own,

To barbers, and to blear·eyed folk is known.
Persius had wealth by foreign traffic gain’d‚ 5

And a vexatious suit with King maintain’d.

Presumptuous‚ vain, and obstinate the wight‚

Conquering even King in virulence of spite3

In bitterness of speech outstripp’d the wind,

And left the swift-tongued Barrus far behind. 10
Now to the King returns our wandel-ing tale,

When all fair means of reconcilement fail;

(For men are obstinate when war’s proclaim’d,

As they with inward courage are infiamed;

When Hector and Achilles fierce engaged, 15

Dire was the conflict‚ and to death they raged:

And why? because the-gallant thirst of fame,

The love os glory‚ was in both extreme.

But if a quarrel between eowards riso..

Or between chiesa of less heroic size, 20

Glaucus to Diomed is forced to yield‚

The dastard buys his peace, and quits the field.)
What time o er Asia with pretorial sway

Great Brutus ruled‚ began this dire affray.

Persius and King‚ intrepid pair, engage, 25

(More equal cham ions never mounted stage)

And now they rus impetuous into court,

Fine was the sight, and delicate the sport.

1 Persius was a Greek b his father, and an ltalian by his mo-
ther. The Romans gave t e name of ibrida to them whose pa·
rents were of different nations, or of different conditions.— Torr.
