Boon v.—om·: 1. 173

Shall I th' unkind command obey,
And idly waste my joylese hours away3 10
Or, as becomes the brave, embrace
The lorious toil, and spurn the thoughts os peace!
wiu ; and over Alpine snow,
Or savage Caucasus inti-epid go;

Or follow, with undaunted breast, 15 ,

Thy dreadful wal-fare to, the sarthest west.
You ask, what aid I can afim-d,
A puny warrior, novice to the sword:
Absence, my lord, increases fear;
The danger lessens when the friend is near: 20
ThuS, if the mother-bird forsake
Her unfledged young, she dreads the gliding snake,
With deeper agonies afraid,
Not that her presence could afford them aid.
With oheerful heart will 1 sustam, 25
To purchase your esteem‚ this dread campaign:
Not that my ploughS, with heavier toil,
Or with a larger team, may turn my soi13
Not that my flock8‚ when Sirius teigne,
May browse the vei-dure of Lucania’s plains; 30
Not that my villa shall extend
To where the walls of Tusculum ascend.
Thy bounty largely hath supplied,
Even with a lavish hand, my utmost pride ;
Nor will I meanl wish for more, 36
Tasteless in earth to {ide the sordid store,
L1ke an old miser in the play,
01· like a spendthrist εςιιῖξιᾶει· it away.
