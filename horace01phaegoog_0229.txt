Οι· write in mere prosaic thymes like me,
That can deserve the name of poetry.
Is there a man, whom real genius mest, 55
Whom the diviner soul of verse inspires 3
Who talks true greatness3 let him boldly claim
The sacred honours of a poet’s name.
Some therefore ask, can comedy be thought
A real poem since it may be wrought 60
[ιι style and subject without fire or force,
And, bate the numbers, is but mere discourse.
‘⁴ But yet in passion’d tone the sire can chide
His spendthrist son, who spurns the portion'd bride
And keeps a common wench‚ or deep iu drink 65
Reels in fair daylight(shamefu1) with his link.”
Yet could Pomponius from his father hear,
Were he alive, a lecture less severe}
’Tis not enough your language to refine,
When if you break the measures of the line, ⁷⁰.
In common life an angry father-'s rage
Is but the same as Demea’s on the stage.
'Pake from Lucilius’ verseS, or from mine,
The cadences and measures of the line;
Then change their order, and the words transpose, 75
No more the scatter’d poet’s limbs it shows;
Not· so-—when hideous discord bursts the bars
And iron gates, to pour forth all her warS. ’
Os this enough ; some future work shall show
Whether ’tis real poetry or no· 80
Now tell me, whether satire should appear,
With reason, such an object os your sear.
Sulcius and Caprius, fiercest os their trade,
Hoarse with the virulence with which they plead‚
When through the streets they stalk with libels arm’d,
Mai-k! how the thieves and robbers are alarm’d; 86
But yet the man of honest hands and pure
May scorn them both, in innocence secure:
Or though like Caelius you a villain be, ·
I’m no informer. Whence you sears os mel 90
