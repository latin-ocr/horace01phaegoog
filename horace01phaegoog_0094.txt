While now her bending neck she lies 2⁵
Backward to meet the burning ‘ss‚
Then with an eas cruelty denie8‚
Yet wishes you woul match, not ask the bliss.

ODE xm!

Eunu-rmus on a tree, by the fall of which our poet had been
nearly crushed.

Wnocvnn raised and planted thee,

Unlucky and pernicious tree‚

In hour accursed with impious hand,

(Thou bane and scandal os my land‚)

Well ma I think the arricide 5

In blood ’s guilty so had died,

Or plunged his dagger in the breast,

At midnight‚ os his sleeping guest,

Or temper’d every balesul juice‚

Which poisonous Colchian glebes produce,

Oris a blacker crime be known, 11

That crime the wretch had made his own,

Who on m harmless grounds and me

Bestow'd ῐζθε, 100κ1οἓε falling tree. .
While dangers hourly round us wait, 15

No caution can prevent our sate.

All other deaths the sailor dareS,

who yet the raging ocean fears3

The Parthian views with deep dismay

The Roman chaine, and firm array; 20

The Reman dreads the Parthian’s speed‚

His flying war, and backward reed3

ἢ 1t may be worth‘obeerving that there is no subject, however
trivinl or inconsiderable, which poetry cannot raise into gran-
deur and dignity. The fall of a trec might have alarmed a
writer of prose, who would coldly have described his danger ;
but the terrore of a ,poetical imagination have transported
Horace to the very regions of death, where he singu the power
of music and poetry.
