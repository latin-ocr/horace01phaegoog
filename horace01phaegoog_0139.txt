BOOK ιιι-ουκ xx. 127

But where the best Chiau, or what it may eost ye, 5

Or how we may warm the long winter and frosty‚

Or temper our water with embersso glowing‚

Ah! Telept1u8‚ here thou art strangely unknowing.

Here’ls a humper to midnight; to Luna's first

s unm ;

A third to ou} friend in his post of.divining. ’ 10

Come fill up the bowl„ then fill up your humpen,

Let three, or thrice three, be the jovial of numbers-

‘I'he poet enraptured‚ sure never refuses

His brimmers thrice three to his odd-number'd
muses;

flut the graces, in naked simplicity cautious, 15

‚ Are afiiaid {rore thau three might to quarrels de-

· auc ue.

Gay frolick and mirth to madness shall fire us3

Why breathes not the flute then with· joy to inspiro
us .

Why hangs ou the wall, in silence dolorous‚

The sost-swelling‘pipffi and the hautboy sonorousl 20

I hate all the slaves who are sparing os labour3

Give us roses abundant, and let our old neighbour‚

With his damsel‚ ill suited to such an old sellom

Even burst with his envy to hear us so mellow.

Poor Horace in ssameS, how slowly consuming! 25

For Glycera burns, while Chloe the blooming χ

Her Telephus courtS, whose tresses are beaming,

As are the bright rays from Vesperus streaming.

ODE xx.—To PYRRHUS.

Houcn dissuades Pyrrhus from endeavouring to force a beau·
tiful youth from his damsel.

Pvmums, you tempt a danger high
When you would steal from hungry h‘-
onees her cuba, and soon shall fly

. lnglorious.
