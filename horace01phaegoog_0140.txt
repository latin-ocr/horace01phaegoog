ODE XXL—TO HIS GASK

nonen implores his cask to furnish him with genereus wine
in compliment to Messala.

Gummi· cask of mellow wine,
And of equai age with mine3
Whether you to broile or mirth,
Or to madding love give birth3
Or the toper' s temples steep 5
Sweetly m ambrosial sleep·
For whatever various use
Yon reservo the chosen Juiee,
Wort of some festa] honr,
Now tge ehoary vintage pour-z 10
Come—Corvinu8‚ guest divine,
Bids me draw the smoothest wine.
Thou 11 with science deep imbued,
