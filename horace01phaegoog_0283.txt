Boon 11.—SA'1·1RF. v. 271

'Your name in full reversion may supply
Thenoid3 sor seldom fails this lucky die.

If any one desires you to peruse
His will, be sure you modestly refuso,
And push it from you ς but obliquely read 85
The second clause, and quick run o'er the deed;
Observing‚ whether, to reward your toil,
You claim the whole, or must divide the spoil-

A season’d scrivener‚ bred in office low,
Fun osten dupeS, and mocks the gaping crow. 90
Thus soil'd‚ Nasica shall become the sport
Os old Coranus, while he pays his court.
U. What! are you mad, or purposed to propose
obscure predictions‚ to deride my ποθεῖ .
Τ. Oh son of great LaerteS, everything 95
Shall come to pase, οι· never, as 1 sing3 ·
For Phoebus, monarch os the tunesul Nine,
Informs rny soul, and gives me to divine.

U. But, good Tiresias, if you please, reveal
What means the sequel of that mystie tale. 100
Τ. What time a youth, who shall sublimely trace

From famed AEneas his heroic rane,
The Parthian’s dread, triumphant shall maintain
His boundless empire over land and ,main ;
Nasica, loath to reimburse his coin, 105
His blooming daughter shall discreetly join
'I'o stout Coranus, who shall slyly smoke
The harpy's aim, and turn it to a joke‚
The son-in-law shall gravely give the sire
His witness’d will, and presently desire 110
That he would read it: coyly he eomplie8‚
And silent cons it with attentive eyes;
But finds, alas! to him and his fol-lom
No legacy bequeath’d-exeept to mourn.
Add to these precepta„ is a crafty lass, 115
Or freedman manage a delirious ase,
Be their ally3 their saith applaud‚ that you.
When absent, may receive as much in lieu;
