BOOK 1.-—onn vm. 27

So, PlancuS, be the ha py wisdom thine 25
To end the cares of li e in mellow'd wine ς
Whether the camp with banners bright display'd‚
Or Tibur hold thee in its thick-wrought shade.
When Teucer from his sire and country fied,
With poplar wreaths the hero crown’d his head, 30
Reeking with wine, and thus his friends address’d,
Deep sorrow brooding in each anxious breast;
Bold let us follow through the foamy tides,
Where fortune, better than a father, guides;
Avaunt despair, when Teucer calls to fame, ‚3⁵
The same your augur, and your gulde the same.
Another Salamis, in foreign clime‚
With rival pride shall raise her head sublime3
So Phoebus nods; ye sons os valour true,
Fun osten tried in deeds os deadlier hue, 40
'Po-day with wine drive every care away,
To-morrow tempt again the boundless sea.

25 The philosophy of Epicurus in the hand of Horace is a
universal remedy. lt sortifies the mind in disgrace3 it dissi-
ωε our cares, and cures superstition. It is a constant refuge

m the cold of winter, and the heat of summer; the pains of
sickness, and the terrore os death.

'ome Vnt-To mnus·

Hessos blames L dia sor engaging Sybaris in dishonourable

ameum, and 1 ing him leave those manly exercises to
which he had been accustomed.

By the goda, my Lydia, tell,
Ah! why, by loving him too well,
Why you hasten to destroy
Young Sybaris, too amorous boyl

ὓ The design of this ode is not to reproach Sybaris with
effeminacy‚ or his love of pleasure; but it seems to be written
either in resentment or J‘ealousy with regard to Lydia, who kept
him diuguisod in a female dream—Dae.
