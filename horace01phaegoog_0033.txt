ODE IIL—TO THE SHIP IN WHICH VIRGIL
SAILED ΤΟ ATHENS.*

Romen wishes virgil a prosperetis voyage, and iureighn
against the impious boldness of mankind.

So may the cyprian queen divine,
And the twin-stars with saving lustre shine;
So may the father of the wind
All others, but the western breezeS, bind,
As you, dear vessei, safe restore,
'rh’ intrusted pledge to the Athenian shore,
And of my soul the partner save,
My much-loved Virgil from the raging wave.
Or oak, or brass, with triple sold,

laws o nature; an impious defiance of the will and power of
the gods. 111 the remainder of the ode, with a noble moral spirit,
he condemns in general the daring irnpiety of mankind, as 11· he
saw it rise from the same principle which inspired their first at-
tempta on the ocean. Thus ‚we see how regular and strongly
connected were the ancient Pindanc poemS.

Virgilwent to Athens in the year of Rome 735, which fixes
the date of this ode—Le Fev. San.
