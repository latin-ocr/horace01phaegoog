Soon upouher bridal day,
Thus the joyful maid shall say,
When the great revolving year
Bade the festa] mom appear,
High the vocal hymn I raised,
And the listeniug gods were pleased3 ’
All the vocal h mn divine,
Horace, tunes hard, was thiae.

FIRST coNGERT.-HYMN 'ro APOLLo.

GHORUS 01¹¹ Yov‘rns Arm vlumus-

Τνέγσε, with impious lust inspired,
By chaste Latona's beauties tired,
Thy xvv-rath, oh Phoebus, tried;

And Niobe, of tongue profane,

Deplored her numerous offspring elain,
Sad victims of their mother’s pride.

Achilles too, the son of fame,
Though sprung from Thetis, sea-born dame,
And first of men in fight,
'I'hough wal-ring with tremendous spem·
He shook the Trojan towers with sear,
Yet bo‘w'd to thy superior mIght3
The cypres& when by storms impell’d,
Or pino, by biting axes sell’d,
Low bends the towering head:
So falling on th’ ensanguined plain,
By your unerring arrow slain‚
His mighty bulk the hero spread.

He had not Priam’s heedless court,

Dissolved in wine, and festal sport,
With midnight art surprised3

But bravely bold, of open force,

Had proudly scorn'd Minerva’s horse,
And all its holy cheat despised5
