Who knows not how to use the massy store,
Yet dreads to violate the sacred oret .
With a long-club, and ever-open eyeS, 155
To guard his corn its wretched master lies,
Nor dareS‚ though hun y, touch the boarded grain,
While bitter herbs his rugal life sustain; ”
If in his cellar lie a thousand flasks
(Nay‚ let them rise to thrice a thousand casks) 160
Of old Falernian, or the Chian vine,
Yet if he drink mere vinegar for wine;
Is, at sourscore, of straw he made his bed,
While moths upbn his rottin carpet sed,
By few, forsooth, a madman e is thought, 165
For half mankind the same disease have caught.
Thou dotard, cur-sed in the 'onfe of pelf,
For sear os starving, will you-starve yourself 3
Or do you this ill-gotten treasure save
For a luxurious son or favourite sla'vel 170
How little would thy mass of money waste,
Did you on better oil and cabbage feast,
Or on thy clotted hair, and dandruff head,
A sweeter, more expensive essence shedl
Is nature wish sor no immoderate store, 175
'When you forswear‚ and rob, and steal for more,
Still are you sound ἶ* But, when your solly raveS‚
Is you should stone the people‚ or your slaves;
These bslaveS, whom you with pelf‚ how precious!
u ‚ ·
Our boysznd girls “ A madman! madman !” cry. 180
Is your head safe, although you hang your wife,
Or take by poison your old mother's lifez
What! nor in Argos you commit the deed,
Nor did your mother by a dagger bleed;
Nor by a mad Orestes was she slain— 185
But was Orestes of untainted hrain,
Or was he not by furies dire possess'd
Before he plunged his dagger iu her breast3
Yet from the time you hold him hurt in mind,
His aptions are of harmleSS, blameless lund. 190
