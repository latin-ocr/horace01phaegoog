ODE XI. —To PETTIUS

Houcn says he is so much in love that he cannot supply him·
self to the study of poetry.

Smer„- cruel love, oh Pettius! pierced my heart,
How have 1 lost, my once· loved lyric art!
, Thrice have the woods their leafy honour mourn ’“ᾱ
Since sor Inachia' s beauties Horace burn’ d.
How was I then (sor I consess my shame) ⁵
Of every idle tale the laughing theme!
Oh! that I ne'er had known the jovial feast,
Where the deep sigh, that rends the labouring breast,
Where languor, and a gentle silence shows
To every curious eye the lover' s woes. 10

Pettiu8‚ how osten o’ er the flowing bowl,
When the gay liquor warm 'd my opening soul,
When Bacchus, jovial god, no more restrain ’d’
The modest secret, how have I complain' d,
That wealthy hlockheadS‚ in a semale' s eyes, 15
From 11 fin-[¹1¹ poet 5 genius bear the prize;
Eut if a gi 1111 mus tage my breast should warm,
11, swute-nn 1 ain amusements e' er shall charm
My 1111111111,ῚΓ wnu11115.Ye vagrant winde, receive
Γ1111111111 that ,11111111 the pains they should· relieve,
Here 11 11111 my 1111111111 of being conquer 'd end, 21
Nur wilh 11111] rim ils will I more contend.

When 1111111, with solemn air, I vauntin said,
ἷΠ-ῗμίπω sl hy 1111 11111108, Ι homeward Spe
Eut ,1111 1113,Γ 111111 111 wonted wanderings may, 25
And to no friendly doors my steps betray;
There I forget my vova, forget my pride,
And at her threshold lay my tortured side
