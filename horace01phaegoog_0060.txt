ODE xxv1.—To HIS MUSE.

'Pan poet implores his muse to enable him to celebrate tha,
praisee of Lamia.

Wmm in the muse’s friendship bless’d,
Nor sear, nor grief, shall break my τεοῖς
Bear them, γε vagrant winds‚ away,
And drown them m the Cretan sea.
Careless am Ι, or who shall reign ὅ
The tyrant os the Scythian plain;
Or with what anxious sear oppress’d,
Heaves Tiridates’ panting breast.

. Sweet muse, who lov’st the virgin spring,
Hither thy sunny flow’rets brin ‚ 10
And let thy richest chaplet she
Its fragrance round my Lamia's head,

κ For naught avails the poet’s praiso
Unless the muse inspire his lays.

Oh! string the Lesbian lyre again, 1⁶
Let all thy sisters raise the strain,
And consecrate to deathless same
My loved‚ my Lamia’s honour’d name.
