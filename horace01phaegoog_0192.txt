HOMO!-

Believe that Folia shared their rites, 65
She who in monstrous lusts delighta ς
Whose voice the stare from heaven can tear, ·
And charm bright Luna from her sphere.

Here, with blank tooth and livid jawz,
Her unpared thumbs Canidia gnava, 60
And into hideous acuente broke‚
In soumis, how direful! thus she spelte-z

“ Ye powers of darkness and of hell,
Propitious to the magio spen, ⁸
Who rule in silence o'er the night, 65
While we perform the mystio rite,
Be present now ; your horrors shed
In hallow’d vengeance on his head.
Beneath the forest’s gloomy eliade,
While beaste in elumbers sweet are laid, 70
Give me the lecher, old and lewd,
By barking village curs pursued;
Exposed to laughter‚ let him shine
In essence—ah! that once was mine.
What! shall my sti-ongean ,potions fail, 75
And could Medea's chartus prevail‘!
When the fair harlot, proud os heart,
Deep felt the vengeance of her art;
Her gown with powersul isons died,
In flames inwrapt the gui ty bride. 80
Yet every root and herb I know,
And on what steepy depths they grow3

. And yet, with essence round him abed,

- He sleeps in some bold harlot’s bed3 .

Or walks at large, nor thinks of me, 85
