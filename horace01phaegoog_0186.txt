ODE IL—THE PRAISES OF A GOUNTRY
LIFE.

Am’mns the usurer, weary of his crast, praises a country Μῦς
but shortly aster, overcome wlth avanee, he returns to hi·
’,- natural beat, and his old way of living.

Lura the'first mortals bless’d is he,
From deth‚ and usury, and business free,

With his own team who ploughs the soil,
Which grateful once consessssd his father-’s toiL

The sounds of war nor break his sleep, 5
Nor the rough storm that harrows up the deep:

He shuns the courtier’s haughty door8,

“ And the loud science os the bar abjilres.

Sometimes his marriageable vines
Around the lofty bridegroom elm he twines; 10
Or lops the vagrant boughs away,
Ingrasting better as the old decay:
Or in the vale with j0y surveys „
His lowing herd sare-wandering as they graze;
Or careful stores the flowing gold 15
Press'd from the hive‚ or shears his tender sold3
Or when with various fruits o’erspread,
The mellow Autumn lists his beauteous head,
His grafted pears or grapeS, that vie
With the rich purple os the Tyrian die, 20
, Gratesul he gathers, and repays
His guardian gods upon their festa] days3
Sometimes beneath an ancient shade,
Or on the matted grass supinely laid,
Where pours the mountain stream along, 25
And feather’d warblers chant the soothing song;
Or where the luoid sountain fiows‚
And with its murmurs courts him to repose.

10 The countryman here chooses the tallest trees, that he
may have the best wine, for Pliny tells us high trees give a richer
wine, and lower trees a greater quantity.-Dac.
