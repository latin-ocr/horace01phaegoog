Os those with acorns fed3 though fat, indeed,

The rest are vapid from the marshy reed.

The vine-fed goat’s not always luscious fare; 55
Wise palates choose the wings of pregnant hare.

None before me so sapient to engage
To tell the various nature, or the age
Of fish and fow13 that secret was my own,

Till my judicious palate quite unknown. 60

In some new pastry that man’s genius lies ;

Yet in one art ’t1s meanness to be wise-
For should we not be careful‚ lest our oil,
Though excellent our wine, the fish should spoil!

The sky serene, set out your Massie wine ; 65
In the night air its foulness shall refine,

‚ And lose the ssent unfriendly to the nerves,
Through linen strain’d, no flavour it preserves.

He, who with art would pour a stronger wine

On smooth Falernian leeS‚ should well refine 70
Th’ incorporated mass with pigeons' eggs3

The falling yolk will carry down the dregs.

Stew’d shrimps and Afric cockles shall excite
A jaded drinker's languid appetite ;

But lettuce after wine is oold and crude, 75
Yet ham or sansage is provokin food3

Perhaps he may prefer with hig er zest

whatever in a filthy tavern's dress’d.

Two sorts of sance are worthy to be known ;
Simple the first, and of sweet oil alone: 80
The other mix’d with rich and generous wine,

And the true pickle of Byzantian brine ς
Let it with shredded herbs and saffron boil,
And when it cools pour in Venafran oil.

Picenian fruits with juicy flavour grow‚ 85
But Tibur's with superior beauty glow.

Some rapes have with success in pots been tried:
The ban better in the smoke are dried;

With them and apples and the lees os wine,

White pepper‚ common salt, and hei-ring brine, 90
