The sanor, who with scarless spirit dares
The rising tempest‚ courts with anxious prayers:

Thee, the rough Dacian, thee, the vagrant band

Os field-born Scythiam, Latium’s warlike land, 10
Cities and uadens, mother-queens revere,

And purple tyranny beholds with sear.

Nor in thy rage with foot destructive spum

This standing pillar‚ and its strength o'erturn3

Nor let the nations rise in bold uproar, 15
And civil war, to break th’ impenal power.

With solemn pace and firm, in awful state

Before thee stalks inexorable Fate,

And grasps empaling mils, and wedges dread,

The hook tormentouS, {md the melted lead: 90

Thee, hope and honour, now, alas, how rare!
With white enrobed, attend with duteous care,
When from the palace of the great you fiy

ln angry mood, and garb of misery.

Not such the crowd of light companions prove, 25
Nor the false mistress of a wanton love,

Faithless who wait the lowest dregs to dmin,

N or friendships equal yoke with strength sustain.

Propitious guard our Caesar, who explores

His venturous way to farthest Britain’s shore; 30
Our new-raised troops be thy peculiar care,

Who dreadful to the east our banners bear.
