Give me to sing, by thee inspired‚
Thy priestesses to madness fired:
Fountains of wine shall pour along, 15
And, melting from the hollow tree,
The golden treasures os the beo,
And streams of milk shall fill the song.

Fair Ariadne’s crown shall fise,
And add new glories to the skies3 20
While Ι to listening nations tell
. How impious Pentheus’ palace burn‘d‚
With hideous ruin overturn’d,
And how the mad Lycurgus fell.

Indus and Ganges own thy sway, 25
Barbarie seas thy power obey,

And o’er the pathless mountain’s height,
(Her head with horrid snakes enroll’d‚
Which harmless writhe their angry sold,)

Thy raptured priestess speeds her ssight. 30

When rising fierce in impious arms,

The giant race with dire alarms
Assail'd the sacred realms of light,

With lion wrath‚ and dreadful paw,

With blood-besmear’d and soaming jam 35
You put their horrid chief to ssight.

For dancing sorm'd, sor love and wit,
Yon seem’d sor war's rude toils unfit,
“ And polish’d to each soster grace:
But dreadsul when in arms you shone, 40
You made the fatal art your own,
In war excelling as in peace.
