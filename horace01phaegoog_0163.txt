When faithless Hannibal at length express’d
The boding sorrows os his anxious breast: ‚ 60

“Like 'stags, of coward kind, the destined prey
Os rav’ning wolves‚ we unprovoked defy
These, whom to baffle is our fairest play,
The richest triumph we can boast, to fly.
For mark that race, which to the Latian shore, 65
Their gods, their sonS, their sires, intrepid bore.

“ That race, long toss'd upon the Tuscan waves,
Are like an oak upon the woody top

Os shaded AlgiduS‚ imbrown'd with leaveS‚ ,
Which, as keen axes its green honours lop, 70

Through wounds, through losses no decay can feel,

Collecting strength and spirit from the steel.

‘⁶ Not Hydra stronger, when dismember’d‚ rose
Against Alcmena’s much-enduring son,

Grieving to find, from liis repeated blows‚ 75
The foe redoubled, and his toil begun:

Nor Colchis teem'd‚ nor Echionian Thebes

A feller monster from their bursting glebes.

“ In ocean plunge them, they emerge more bright;
At arms oppose them in the dusty field, 80
with routed squadrons they renew the fight3
And force your yet unbroken troops to yield,
And battles wago, to be the future boast
Os their proud consorte o’er our vanquish’d host.

‘⁴ To losty Carthage 1 no more shall send 85
Δ Vaunts ot· my deedS, and heralds ot· my fame;

61 Thiseulogium of the Romans is in itself magnificent2but
it bsecomes infimtely more valuable in the mouth of Hannibal.
