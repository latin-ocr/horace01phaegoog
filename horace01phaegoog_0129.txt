BOOK ιιι-ουκ xl. · ΠΥ

’Tis your-S, with all their beasts of pre'y, 15
To bid the forests move, and powerful stay
The rapid stream. The dog os hell,
hmense os bulk, to thee sort-soothing fell,
And suppliant bow'd‚ though round his head
His hundred snakes their guardian horrors spread; 20
Balesul his breath though fiery glow'd‚
And stom his three-tongued jaws fell poison flow'd.
Ixion, os his pains beguiled, .
And Tityus, with unwilling pleasure, smiled;
Dry stood their urn, while with eost strain 25
You soothed,the labours os the virgin trnin
Let Lyde hear, what pains, decreed‚
'l'hough late, in death attend the diresul deed.
There doom’d to fill, unceasing task!

⁴ With idle toil‚ an ever-streaming cask3 ³0

Impious,¹ who in the hour os rest,
Could plunge their daggers in a husband's breast.
Yet worthy os the nu tial flante,
And nobly meriting a deat less name,
Of man , one untainted maid, 3⁶
Gloriously siglae, her perjursd sire betray'd.
Thus to her youtht'ul iord-Arium
Awake‚ lest sleep eternal close thino eyes;
Eternal sleep: and, ah! from whom
You little dreaded the relentless doom. 40
Oh! ny, my lorti, this w'rathful sire;
Far stom my sisters, fly‚ those sistere dire,
Who riot in their husbands’ blood,
As lionesses read their panting food3
While Ι, to such fell deeds a soe, 4⁵
Nor bind thee here, nor strike the fatal blow.
Me iet my father load with enaim,
Or banish to Numidia’s sarthest plains3
My crime, that Ι a loyal wife,
ln mercy spared a wretched husband's life. 50
while* Venus, and the shades os night

Protect thee, sperici, by sea or land, thy ssight.
