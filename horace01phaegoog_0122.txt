110 . . HORACE. .

oDE V15-—To THE ROMANS.

ΙΝ this ode the poet invelghs a inst the contempt of religion
and corruption of mo among the Romans.

Tnouen guiltless of your fathers’ crimea,
Roman, ’tis thine, to latest times,
The vengeance of the gods to bear,
Till you their awful domes repair, “
Prosaned with smoke their statues mise, 5
And bid the sacred altars blaze.
That you the powers divine obey,
Boundless on earth extend your sway3
From hence your future glories date,
From hence expect the hand os fate. 10
Th’ offended goda, in horrors dire,
On sad Hesperia pour’d their ire:
The Parthian squadrons twice repell’d
Our inauspicious powers», and quell’d
Our boldest effortS‚ while they shone 15
With spoiIS, from conquer’d Romans won.
The Daciam„ whose unerring art
Can wing with death the pointed dart;
Th’ Egyptian, for his navies iamed,
Had N eptune's boundless empire claim’d, 20
And almost in their tage destroy'd
Imperial Rome, in civil strise employ'd.
Fruitsul of crimea, this age first stain’d
Their hapless offspring‚ and profaned
The nuptial bed, from whence the werae, 25
That various and unnumber'd rose
From this polluted sonutam-head, ,
O’er Rome, and o’er the nations spread.

14 The aruspices and inspectore of the victims foretold to
Graecus that ‘his expedition should prove unfortunate. Many
prodigies, which hap ‘en-ed while he uta ed at Zeu a, seemed
to confirm their predtictions. ‘Cras’sus enpiaed alflxt'hene pree·
agea, and hurried forward to his rum.
