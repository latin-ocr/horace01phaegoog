Now the Latian song, my lyre,

with some immortal strain inspire‚

Such as once Aleaeus sung, 5
who, fierce in war, thy music strung‚

When he heard the battle roar,

Or moor’d his sea-toss’d vessel on the shore.
Wine and the muses were his theme,

And VeImS, laughter·loving dame,

With Cupid ever by her side, 10
And LycuS‚ sorm’d in beauty's pride,

With his hair of jetty dye‚

And the black lustre of his eye.

Charming shelI, ,ΑροΠοέ love,

How grateful to the feasts os Jove! 15
Hear thy poet’s solemn prayer,

Thou sost’ner of each anxious care.

j ODE XXXIII.—TO ALBIUS TIBULLUS.
Ι Hono· endeavours to console Tibullus by instancing other·
who were in love without a mutual return. ,

No more in elegiae strain
of cruel Glycera complain,
Though she resign her faithless chal-ms
To a new lover’s younger arms·
The maid, for lovely sorehead iamed, 5
With C rus' beauties is infiamed; -
While holo‘e'‚ os haughty eharms‚
The panting breast os Cyrus warms3
But wolves and oats shall sooner prove =
The pleasures οξ forbidden love ιο
Thau she her virgin honour stain,
And not the filthy rake disdain.
So Venus wius, whose power controls
The fond affections os our souls;
With sportive cruelty she binds 15

Unequal forms, unequal mindo.
