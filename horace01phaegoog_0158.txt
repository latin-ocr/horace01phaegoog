Thus, when the Theban swan attempts the skiem
A nobler gale of rapture bids him rise3 26
But like a bee, which through the breezy groves
With feeble wing and idle inurmurs toves,

Sits on the bloom, and with unceasing toil
From thyme sweet-breathing culls his flowery spoi13
So 1, weak bard ! round Tibur’s lucid spring, 31
Of humbler strain laborious verses sing.

’Tie thine with deeper hand to strike the lyre
When Caesar shall his raptured bard inspire3
And crown'd with laurel, well-earn'd meed os war,
Drag the fierce Gaul at his triumphal car. 36

Than whom the gods ne'er gave, or bounteous fate,
To humankind a gift more good or great,

Nor from the treasures shall again unsold,
Though time roll backward to his ancient gold. 40

Be thino the festal days, the city's joyS,

The forum silenced from litigious noise3
The public games sor Caesar sase restored,
A bleseing ost with pious vows implored.

Thon, if my voice can reach the glorious theme,
'Fl'ien will 1 sing, amid the loud acclaim— 46
“ Hail, brightest sun ! in Rome's fair annals shine3
Caesar returns—eterna! praise be thine.”

As the procession awsul moves along,

Let shouts os triumph fill our joyful song3 50
Repeated shouts of triumph Rome shall raise,
And to the bounteous gods our altars blaze.

Os thy sair herds twice ten shall grateful bleed,
while I, with pious care, one steerling seed:
Wean'd from the dam, o'er pastures large he toves,
And sor my vows his rising youth he proves: 66

His horns like Lu'na’s bonding fires appear,
When the third night she rises to her sphere;

And, yellow all the rest, one spot there glows
Fun in his from, and bright as winter snowS. 60
