1 visit one—to eut the atrise,
You never saw him in your life;
N or would 1 lead you such a round-· 35
He lives above a mile of ground
Beyond the Tiber.” “ Never talk
Of distance, sor Ilove a walk-
1 never have the least enjoyment
In idleness: 1 want employment. 40
Come on; I must and will attend
Your person to your journey's end.”
Like vicious ase, that stetting bears
A wicked load, 1 hang my θῆτες
While he, renewing his civilities‚ 4⁶
“ If well Ι know my own abilitie8‚
Not visenti, though your friend of yore‚
Not Varius could engage you more;
For who can write melodious lays
With 'greater eleganee or ease‘! 50
Who moves with smoother grace his limbo

³ While through the mazy dance he swimst

Resides, I sing to that degree,
Hermogenes might envy me.'’
Have you no mother, sister, friendS, 55
Whose welfare· on your health depende ³-
“ Not one; I saw them all by turns
Securel settled in their urnS.’'
Thrice appy they, secure from pain!
And 1 thy victim now remain3 60
Despatch me; for my goody nurse
Early presaged this heavy curse:
She conn’d it by the sieve and shears,
And now it falls upon my ears—
Nor oison fell, with ruin stoi-ed, 66
Nor orrid point os hostile sword,
Nor pleurisy, nor asthma cough, s
Nor cripple gout shall cut him off:
A noisy tongue, and babbling breath,
shall teaze aad talk mv child to death. 70
