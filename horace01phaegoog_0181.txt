noox ive-ona xv. 169

The Danube, and the ocean wild that roars,
with monster-bearing πανοῦ, «round Britain’s roeky

shores,
The fearleaa Gaul thy name reveres,
Thy voice the rough Iberian hem, 50
with arms com sed the fieree Sicambriana yield,
Nor view, with ear delight, the earnage of the field.

ODE xv.—To AUGUSTI] Sff*

Houor. dedicatee this ode 1,teo aaegmm' on the restoration of

1 woum have sung of battlee dire,
And mighty eitles overthrow,
When Phoebus smote me with his lym,
And warn'd me, with an angi-y tone,
Not to unfold my little sail, or brave 5
The boundleas terrers of the Tyrrheno wave.

Yet will I sing thy peaeeljul reign,
Which crowns with fruita our happy fleme,

the west about twenty-five leagnes. At last, flowing through
Emssss it &bargen itself into the Mediterranean by two
mont .—

* ln the latter end of spring, 744, Angustus shut the temple

of Janue sor the thud and laet time, which probably gave occa-
aion to this ode—San. ‘
, 3 Horace eould not flatter Angustus more agreeably than bf
representing Apollo mtereaung himself sor hia glory, and orb1 -
ding the poet to attempt his militarv actions, since nt was impoe-
aible to celebrate them with a d'ignity equal to the subject.
This addrese will appear more delicate and artful, if we remem-
ber how anxious Augustus was to have it believed that Apollo
was hia father and· rotector; particularly that he fought for
him at the battle of otium—San.

5 To attempt with hia feeble genius to aing the victoriea of
Augustus, ia to venture in a little bark on a broad, tem
ocean. The metaphor ia beautiful, the sentiment eat and
the complirnent to Angustus a with equal truflmd' dig-
mtiifor ίιύι a eismplirment pfflgod.
