Rausom’d, no doubt, with nobler sense of fame
The soldier shall return—ye purchase shame. 30
When the sair fleece imbibes the dier’s stain,

Its native colour lost it never shall regain;
And valour‚ sailing in the soldier's breast‚
Scorns to resume what cowardice possess'd.
When from the toils escaped, the hind shall turn 35
Fierce on her humere, he the prostrate soe may spurn

In second fight, who felt the setters bind
His ,arms enslaved3 who tamely hath resign’d
His awurd unamin'd with blood; who might have

eliath ·
Yet on a faisshless fiae, with abjeot souI, relied; 40

Whn sor his safety mix’d poor terma of peace
Even with the act of wan oh foul disgrace !

· Oh Carthago. now with rival glories great,

And [m the mina raiffied os Rome’s dejected state!
The. hem spuma ; :md srom his wedded dame 45
And infant mmmm-11 turn’d‚ oppress’d with shame
Os his fallen state3 their sond embrace repell'd‚
And sternly on the earth his manly vinage held,
Tin, by his unexampled counsel sway'd‚
Their firm decree the wavering senate made3 50
Thon while his friends the tears of sorrow abed,
Amid the weeping throng the glorious exile sped.
Nor did he not the oruel tortures know,
Vengesul, prepared by a barbarian soe ;

Yet, with a countenanoe serenely gay, 55
He ιυῐειῖζίγῖεἰᾶθ the crowd, who sondly press’d hie

Asis, when wearied by some client'e cause, .
After the final sentence os the* lawa, ἱ
Cheersul he hasted to some calm retreat, 59
To taste the pure delighta that blesa the rural seat.
