ODE xxlx.—To MAECENAS.*

Houor: invites Maecenas to a frugal entertainment‚ and admou-
ishes him to lay aeide all anxious cares about futurity.

Descmmm from an ancient line,
That once the Tuscan sceptro sway’d‚
Haste thee to meet the generous wine,
Whose piercing is for thee delay’d;
For thee the fragrant essence stowe, 5
For thee, MaecenaS, breathes the blooming rose.

From' t⁴he delight3‚ oh! break away,
Which Tibur's marshy prospect yioldS,
Nor with unceasing joy survey
Fair AEsula’s declining field83 10
No more the verdant hills admire ’
of Telegon‚ who kill’d his aged sire.

Instant sorsake the joyless feast,
Where appetite in surfeit dieo,
And from the tower’d structure haste. 15
That proudly threatens to the skies;
From Rome and its tumultuous joyS,
Its crowdS, and smoke‚ and opulence‚ and noise.

the orations of emosphenes, tho iambic poema os Archilochus,
and the letters of Ammo, that the longest are not the least
beautissul. To suppor} one continued flpffiht of poetry deservo·
