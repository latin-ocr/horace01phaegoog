Horace. He read the poet’s epistles and satires‚
and felt chagrined and discontented because none
of them were addressed to himself. “I am angry
with you‚” he writes to Horace, ‘⁶ because you do
not especially choose me to converse with in the
principal part of , your writings of this nature. Do

to recover the calamity, as he died within three
weeks after, in the 57th year of his age, Ac. 9,
during the consulate of C. Marcius Censorinus and
C. Asinius Gallus. Horace had on one occasion
declared the impossibility of long surviving his
friend—that one day must bring with it the fall of
both3 and the prediction was very nearly fulfflled.
