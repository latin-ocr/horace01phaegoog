Perfidious to his toil;
whether his drooping trees complain 40
of angry winter's chilling rain,

Or egara that burn the soil.

Not such the haughty lord, who lays
His deep foundations in the aeas,

And seems earth’s narr-ow bound: 4⁵
The fish‚ affrighted‚ feel their waves
Contraeted by his numerous slaves,

Ev'n in the vast prosound.

High though his structuras rise in air,

Pale menacens, and black despair, 50
This haughty lord shall find

O'ertake his armed galley’s speed‚

And when he mounts the flying steed ‚
Sits gloomy care behind.

Is purple, whichthe mem maehina, 5⁵
Or marble from the Phryoeian atinez,
Though labour’d high with art 3
Is essence, breathing ,sweets divine,
Or flowing bowls os genereus wine, s

111 sooth an anxious heart, ⁴ 60

On columne raised in modern style,

Why should l plan the lofty pile
To rise with envied state ἓ

Why, for a vain superfluous stote,

Whrch would encumber me the more, 65
Resign my Sabine seat‘!
