80 nomon·

What intends the Scythian‘s pride,
Far from us whom seas divide.
Tremble not with vain desii-es, 5
Few the things which lise requires.
Youth with rapid swiftness fiies,
Beauty's lustre quickly dies,
Wither'd age drives sar away
Gentle sleep, and amorous play. 10
When in vernal bloom they glow,
Flowers their gayest honours show.
Nor the moon with equal grace
Always lifts her ruddy face.
Thus while nature’s works decay, 15
Busy mortal, prithee say,
Why do you satigue the mind,
Not sor endless schemes design'dl
Thus boneath this lofty shade‚
Thus in careless freedom laid, 20
While Assyrian essence sheds
Liquid fragranee on our heads‚
While we lie with roses erown'd‚ »
Let the eheersul bowl go round:
Bacchus can our cares control, 25
Cares that prey upon the soul.
Who shall from the passing stream
Queneh our wine's Falernian fiame3
Who the vagrant wauton bring,
Mistress of the lyric string‚ 30
With her flowing tresses tied‚
Loosely‚ like a Spartan bride ’ὲ

11 Nothing is less durable than flowers in ring; nothing
more chan eable than the moon3 et these are t e best images
of human· ' e. Why then shoul creatures, by nature formed
to mortali , fati ue themselves with endless and uncertain
