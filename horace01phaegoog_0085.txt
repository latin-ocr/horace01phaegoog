That purer air to let me breathe,
Galesus, thy sweet stream 1⁹11 choose‚ 15

Yield to Hymettus’ golden stores,
Nor the green berry of Venafran soil
Swells with a riper ssood of fragrant oil.

Envies the vintage os Falernian wine. 3ο

The charming hills that round it rise,‘
Your latest hours and mine await3
And when at length your Horace dies,
There the deep sigh thy poet-friend shall mouth, 35
And pious tears bedew his glowing um.
