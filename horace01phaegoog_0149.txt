‘⁴ Indulge‚'' she crieS, “thy rage no more, ,
This odious bull shall yield him to thy power.
‘⁴ Yet sigh no more but think of love3
For know thou art the wife of Jove:
Then learn to bear thy future fame ⁷5
When earth’s wide continent shall boast thy name.”

76 Horace follows the poetical tradition, for it is more proba-

Macedonia, c led Europia. The ancients divided the whole
earth into two parts, Europe and Asia.—San. Dac.

ODE XXV111.—To LYDE.

Honos invites Lyde to Ῑῇἱὲὲῖῗιιιιὲθ to celebrate the feast of

Sur, what shall 1 do on the festival day

Of N eptune3 Come, Lyde, without more delay,

And broach the good creature, invaulted that lies;

Cast off all reserve, and be merry and wise.

The evening approache8‚ you see, from yon hill; 5

And yet, as is Phoebus, though winged, stood still,

You dally to bring us a cup os the best,

Condemn‘d‚ like its consul, ignobly to rest.

With voices alternate, the sea-potent king,

And the Nereide, with ringlets of amre, we’ll
sin . 10

From the gsweet-sounffing shell thy hand shall raise

, Latona’S, and swist-darting C nthia’s praise.

The gay-smiling goddess of ove and delight‚

Who rules over Cnidus, and Cyclades bright‚

And guiding her swans with a sost silken rein, 1⁵
Revisits her Paphos, shall crown the glad strain.
'rhen to the ood ni ht, while bumpere elate us,
We’llsing a areweffi anil1a2decent quietus, ’
