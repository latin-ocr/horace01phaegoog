At mom, of tetrarchs‚ and of kings he rates;
At night—‘⁶ A three-legg'd table, oh ye ates! ,
A little shell the sacred salt to hold,
And clothes, though coarse to keep me from the cold.”
Yet give the man, thus hugal, thus content, 21
'I'en thousand poundS, and every shilling's spent
In five short days: He drank the night away
Till rising dawn, theri snored out all the day.
Sure such a various creature ne'er was known. 25

Or his large shoes to ‘raillery expose

Of virtues, witfi which very sew are bless’d‘!
While underneath this rude, uncouth disguise

A enius of extensive knowledge lies.

What seeds ot. solly nature planted there, 50
Or custom raised ; for an uncultured field
Shall for the fire its thoi-ns and thistles yield.
And yet a shorter method we ma find,
As lovers, to their fair one fondly bgnd
