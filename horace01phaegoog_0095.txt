BOOK 11.—om: x1v. 83

While death, unheeded‚ sweeps away
The world, his everlasting prey.

How near was I those dreary plainS, 25
Where Pluto’s auburn consort reigns;
Where awsul sits the judge os hell;

Where pious spirits blisssul dwell;

Where Sappho's sweet com laints reprove
The rivals os her fame and ove, 30
Aleaeus holder sweeps the stringe,

And seas, and war, and exile sings.

Thus while they strike the vanous lyre,
The ghosts the sacred sounds admire;

But when Alcaeus tunes the strain 35
To deeds of war, and tyrants elain,

In thicker crowds the shadowy throng
Drink deeper down the martial song.

What wonderz when with bending ears
The dog of hell astonish’d hears, 4⁰
And in the suries’ hair entwined‚

The snakes with cheerful horror wind, ,
While charm’d by the melodicus struma,
The tortured ghosts forget their paine,
Orion quits his bold delight 45
To chase the lion’s rage, or lynx’s night.

Rtnzchom on the shortnesa of life and certainty of death.

How swiftly glide our flying years!
Alae! nor piety, nor teate
