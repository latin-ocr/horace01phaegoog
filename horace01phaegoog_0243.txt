, Persius begins; loud bursts os laughter rise3
He praises Brutus„ BrutuS, to the skies: 30
“ Brutus, like Sol, o'er Asia pours the day;
His friends are stam, and healthful is their ray,
Except the King3 he like the dogstar reignS‚
That dog of heaven, detested by the swains.”-
Thus rush’d he onward like a winter flood, 35
That tears its banks, and sweeps away the wood.
Το this impetuous bitterness of tide
'rho King with equal virulence replied.
A vine-dresser he was, of rustic tone,
Whom oft the traveller was forced to own 40
Invincible; with clamorous voice opress’d‚
When cuckoo, cuckoo, was the standing jest.
But, with Italian vinegar imbued‚
The sour-tongued mongrel the dispute renew'd ,
‘⁸ Let me conjure thee, by the powers divine, 46
Since ’tis the glory, BrutuS, of thy line
'ro slaughter kings, be this thy glorious deed,
That this same King beneath thy vengeance bleed.”

42 Many wise reasons are given why the name of this bird
should be a term of reproach, for such it is, in almost all lan-
gunges. The best· account of it is, that the cuckoo sleeps half
the year, and leaves the care oshis family to others.
⁶ 46 It was an hereditary glory in the family of Brutus to abol-
ish tyranny and punish tyrauts. Lucius Jumus Brutus expelled
having the last monarch of Rome. Marcus and Decius Brutus,
killed Julius Caesar, proclaimed through the streete that they
had destroyed the king of Rome, and the tyrant of his country.

SATIRE VIII.

Pnurus complains that the Esqufflian mount is infested with
the incantatione of sorceresses.

br days of yore our godship stood,

Axvery worthless log os wood‚

The joiner doubting‚ or to shape us

Into a stool‚ or a Priapus,

At length resolved, sor reasons wise, δ
luto a god to bid me rise; ·
