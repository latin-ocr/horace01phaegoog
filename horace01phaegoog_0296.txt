284 ' nomn,

But is our worship's folly less than mine,
When {with wonder view some rude defflgn 1 lo
In crayons or in charcoal‚ to invite
The crowd to see the gladiatore fightz
Methinks‚ in ve deed they mount the stage,
And seem iu re combat to engage3
Now in strong attitude they dreadful bend 3 115
Wounded they wound; they parry and defend ·
Yet Davus is with rogue and rascal graced,
But you’re a critic, and a man of taste.
1 am, forsooth, a good-sor-nothing knave‚
When by a smoking pasty made a slave: 120
In you it shows a soul erect and great,
Is you refuse even one luxurious treat.
Why may not 1, like you, my guts obeyl
‘⁴ My shoulders for the dear indulgence pay.”
But should not you with heavier stripes be taught,
Who search for luxuries; how dearly bought! 126
For soon this endless‚ this repeated feast,
Its relish lost, shall pall upon the taste3
The! shall your trembling limbs refuse the weight
Of a vile carcass with disease replete. 130
How seldom from the lash a slave escapes,
Who trucks some trifie‚ that he stole, sor grapes‘!
And shall we not the servile glutton rate,
To please his throat who sells a good estate ’ἔ
You cannot spend one vacant hour alone3 135
You cannot make that vacant hour your own.
A selsdeserter from yourself you stray,
And now with wine, and now with sleep allay
Your cares; in vain: companions black as night,
Thy pressing cares, arrest thee iu thy ssight. 140
H. Ishthere no stone! D. At whom, good sir, to
t row it -3
H. Have 4Ἰ no dart} D. what mischief ails our
poet.
He's mad, or making verses, H. Hence, you knave!
Or to my farm I'll send you—me ninth slave.
