208 ⁶ nomen.

Your wealth shall purchase some good-natured friend

Your cordials to prepare, your couch attend,

And urge the doctor to preserve your life,

And give you to your children and your wife. 110
Η. Νοι· wife, nor son, that hated lise would save,

While all, who know thee, wish thee in the grave.

And canet thou wonder that they prove unkind‚

When all thy passions are to gold confined‘!
Nature, ’tis true, in each relation gave 115

Afriend sincere3 yet what you thus receive,

If you imagine, with unfeeling heart,

And careless manners to preserve, your art

As' well may teach an ass to scour the plain,

And bend obedient to the forming rein. - {120
Yet somewhere should your views os lucre cease

Nor let your fears of poverty increase,

As does your wealth; for since you now possess

Your utmost wish, your labour should be less.
Ummidius once (the tale is quickly told) 125

So wondrous rich he measured out his gold,

· Yet never dress'd him better than a slave,

Afraid of starving ere he reach’d his grave:

But a bold wench, of right virago stram,

Clest with an axe the wretched wight in twain. 130

M. By your advice what party shall I take 2

· Like Maenius live a prodigal, and rake

Lilte N omentanus3 H. Why will you pretend,

W1th such extremes, your conduct to defendt

The sordid miser when I justly blame, 135

l would not have you prodigal of fame,

Spendthrift or rake; for sure some difference lies

Between the very fool and very'wise:

Some certain mean in all things may be found,

To mark our virtues’ and our vices' bound. 140
But to return srom whence we have digress’d.

And is the miser, then, alone unbless’d‘!

Does he alone applaud his neighbour’s fate, ⁴

Or pine with envy of his happier statel ·
