BOOK 1.—om?: 1‘1. 1⁹

If there the sacred nine inspire 45
The breathing flute, and strike the lyra,

There let me fix my last retreat,

Far from the little vulgar and the great.

But if you rank me with the choir,

Who tuned with art the Grecian lyre, 50
swift to the noblest heights os fame

Shall rise thy poet’s deathless·name.

ODE 11.-To AUGUSTUS.

Homer: dissuades Augustus-from resigning the empire, on ac-
elogii? eg. the prodigies which happened at the beginning of

Enoueu of snow and hail in tempests dire

Have pour'd on earth, while heaven's eternal sire
With red right arm at his own temples hurl’d
His thunder8‚ and alarm'd a guilty world,

Lest Pyrrha should again with plaintive ories 5
Behold the monsters of the deep arise,

When to the mountain summit Proteus drove

His sea-bom herd‚ and where the woodland dove

Late perch’d‚ his wonted seat, the soaly brood
Entangled hung upon the topmost wood‚ 10
And every timorous native os the plain,
High-floating‚ swam amid the boundless main.

We saw, push’d backward to his native source,
The yellow Tiber roll his rapid course z

With impious ruin threatening Vesta's fane, 15
And the great monuments of Numa's reign3

who believed that thunders, which portended any revolution in
a state. were more inflamed than any other, as they fancied that
the lightnings os Jupiter were red and fiery; those of the oum

gods pale and (ἰωὴ-οης.
