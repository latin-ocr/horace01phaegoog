The vagrant hero, son of Jove, 10
Upsoar'd with strength his own, where Caesar hee,
And qualib, with glowing lipS‚ the bowl's immortal

Addressed th’ assembled powers divine—
Troy, hated Troy, an umpire lewd, unjust‚
And a proud foreign dame, have sunk thee to tho
dust.

To me, and wisdom's queen decreed, 21
With all thy guilty race to bleed,
What time thy haughty monarch's perjured sire

Mock’d the defrauded gods, and robb’d them of their ,

Hector no more his faithful brothers leads

'ro breakblthel Grecian sorce; no more the victor

Instant to Mars my vengeance 1 resign‚

And hen} receive his son, though born of Trojan
me.
