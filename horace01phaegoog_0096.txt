HonAcE.

Can stop the fleeting day ς
Deep-furrow’d wrinkles‚ posting ago,
And death's unconquerable rago, ⁵
Are strangers to delay.

Though every day a bul] should bleed
To Plut0‚ bootless were the deed,
The monas-ch tem-less teigne,
Where ‚vulture-tortured Tityus lies, 10
And triple Geryon’s monstrous sizo
The gloomy wave detainS.

Whoever tastes of earthly food
Is doomed to p‘ass the j0yless flood,

And hear the Stygian roan 1⁵
The scepter’d king‚· who mles the earth,
The labouring hind, of humbler birth,

Must reaoh the distant shore.

¹ 'l'he'broken surge of Adria's main,

Hoarse sounding we avoid in vain, 20
And Mars in blood-stain’d arms;

The southern blast in vain we sear,

And autumn's life-annoying air
With idle fears alasm83 '

For all must see Cocytus now, 2³
Whnse gloomy water sadly slow
Strays ¹through the dreary soil.
'Hle guilty maida, an ill-famed train!
And, SisyphuS‚ thy labours vain,
Qondemn'd to endless toil. 3ο

Your pleasing consort must be left,
And ou of villas, lande bel-est,
ust to the shades descend3
The cypress only, hated tree!
Of au th much-loved groves, shall thee, 36
Its s ort-lived lord attend.
