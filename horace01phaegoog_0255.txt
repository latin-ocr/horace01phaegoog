Houor, in this ode, is supposed to consult Trebatius, whether ἵ

he should desist from writing eatires.

Horace. '1⁸11ar are, to whom too poignant 1 appear3
Beyond the laws os satire too severe.
My lines are weak, unsinew'd, others say
‘⁴ A man might spin a thousand such a day.”
What shall I do, Trebatius} Trebatius. Write no
more.

T. Yes. H. Let me die but your advice were beet.
But, eir, 1 cannot sleep3 I cannot rest.
T. Swim o’er the Tiber‚ is you want to sleep.
Or the dull sense in t'other bottle steep: 10
If ou must write, to Caesar tune your lay8‚
Ingilge your genius, and your fortune raise.
H. Oh! were I equal to the glorlous theme,
Bristled with spears his iron war should gleam:
A thousand darts should pierce. the hardy Gaul, 1⁵
And from his horse the wounded Parthian sall.
Τ. Then give his peacesul virtues forth to samm
His fortitude and justice be your theme.
