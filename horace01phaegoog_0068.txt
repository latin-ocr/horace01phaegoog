Thus, when a better Venus strove

To warm my youthful breast to love,

Yet could a slave-born maid detain

My willing heart in pleasing chain, 20
Though fiercer she than waves that roar
Winding the rough Calabrian shore.

ODE ΧΧΧΠΠ·ιι

ΙΝ a pretended recantation‚ Horace overthrows the arguments in
favour of the providence of the gods.

A ruer-nvn: from heaven and prayer,
I mock'd at all religious sear,
Deep scienced in the nrazy lore
Of mad philosophy3 but now
Hoist sail, and back my voyage plough 5
To that bless’d harbour which I left before.

For lo! that awful heavenly sire,
Who frequent cleaves the clouds with fite,
Parent of day, immortal Jove!
Late through the floating fields of air, lo
The face of heaven serene and fair,
His thund'ring steedS, and winged chariot drove;

recantation of the Epicurean philosophy, or whether he lau hs

been 1n the last ten years of his life, as appears by the fourth
epistle os the first book; and as it was a frequent argument

o munder, yet it is sometimes heard in a clear sk . Horace
must have early known an instance of this kind o reasoning,
as well as the stoica! conclusion drawn from it. But besides
