soon 1.—·-om³ xxxv. 67

When, at the bursting of his flames,

The nderous earth, and vagi-ant streams,
emal Styx, the dire abode 15
Of hateful Taenarus prosound‚
And Atlas to his utmost bound,
Trembled beneath the terrers of the god.

The hand of Jove can crush the proud
Down to the meanest of the crowd, 90
And raise the lowest in his stead3
But rapid fortune pulls him down,
And snatches his imperial crown,
'l'o place, not fix it, on another's head.

ODE XXXV.—'ro FORTUNE.*

0111 poet ptays sor Auguffl, thcgmmonwealth, and the Ro-

Gonnsss‚ whom Antium, beauteous town, obeys‚
Whose various will with instant wer can raise

Frail mortale from the depths of ow des air,
or change proud triumphs to the funer tem-3

Thee‚ the poor famer, who with ceaseless pain 5
Labours the glebe3 thee, mistress of the main,

ἓ The subject of this odeis perfectly noble, well desigmed,
md well executed. Its versification 13 flowing and harmonious,
its e ression bold and sublime.

In t e ear 719 Augustus was on his march to Britain, but
was recafled by a revolt of the Dalmatians. In 727, havin
ended the civil wars by the defeat of Antony, he again resolv
to turn his arms against that island, but was satisfied with an
egnbessy from thence, and a promise of obedience to 11ῃῶ eon·
ditions which he pleased to impose on them. These con 'tione
not being well observed he was determined to make the Britons
feel the effects of his displeasure, yet was again obliged to em·
ploy the forces of the republic in snppressing an insurrection
ef the Sallsssi, Cantabri, and Ausum—San. .

1t is indifferent on which of these occasions this ode was
written, audit 13 impossible to determine with any exactness.
