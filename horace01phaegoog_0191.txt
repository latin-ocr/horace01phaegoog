Bring the egge, and plumage foul
of the midnight-shrieking ow13
Be they well besmear’d with blood 2⁵
Of the blackest-veuom’d toad3
From their various climates bring
Every herb that taiute the spring3
Then into the charm be thronum,
Snatch’d from famish’d bitch, a boues 80
Burn them all with magicflame‚
Kindled first by Colchian dame.'’
Now Sagana around the cell
Sprinkled her waters‚ black from hell;
Fierce as 3 percupine or boat, 35
In frightful wreathe her hair she wore.
Veia, who never knew remorae,
Uplists the spade with feeble sorce;
And breathless with the hellish toil,
Deep-groaning breaks the guilty soil3 40
'Purus out the earth, and diga a grave
In which the boy (as o’er the wave
Α lusty swimmer lists his head)
chin-deep siuks downward to the dead,
O’er dammae, changed twice unice, 3 day, 45
Slowly to gaze his lise away;
That the foul hage an amorous dose
Of his patched marrow may compose;
His marrow, and his livet dried,
The seat where wauton thoughts residu 50
When fix'd‘upon his food iu vain,
His eyeballs pined away by pain.
N aplee for idleness renown’d,
And all the villagee around,
