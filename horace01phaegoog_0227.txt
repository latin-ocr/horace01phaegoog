SATIRE IV.

Honos apologizes for th'e liberties taken by satiric poets in
general, and particularly by himself.

They ,freely stigmatized the wretch in rhyme.
From their example whole Lucilius rose,

Though different measureS‚ different verse he chose.

He rallied with a gay and easy air; ⁸

But rude his numbers, and his style severe. lo

The stream runs muddy‚ and the water's foul.

He prattled rhymes; but lazy and unfit 15

For writing well; for much, I own, he writ.
Crispinus thus my littleness defies ;

with exposing the names and characters of the persons whom
