Boox 11.—-sA'r11u·2 v. 269

U. How poor and naked Ι return, behold,
Unerring prophet, as you first foretold. 10
The wooing tribe, in revellings employ’d‚

My stores have lavish‘d, and my herds destroy’d;
But high descent and meritorious deedS‚
Unblessed with wealth, are viler than sea-weeds.

T. Since, to be brief, you shudder at the thought
Of want, attend how riches may be caught. 16
Suppose a thrush, or any dainty thing
Be sent to you, despatch it on the wing
To some rich dotard. What your garden yields,
The choicest honours of your cultured fields, 20
To him be sacrificed, and let him taste,

Before your gods, the vegetable feast.

Though he be perjured; though a low-born knave‚
Stain'd with fraternal blood, a fugitive slave,

Yet wait upon him at his least command, 25
And always bid him take the upper hand.

U. What! shall Ulysses then obey the call
Of such a wretch, and give a slave the wall!

Not thus at Troy Ι proved my losty mind,
Contending ever with the nobler kind. 30
Τ. Then poverty’s your fate. U. And be it so·
Let me with soul undaunted undergo

This loathsome evil, since my valiant heart

In greater perils bore a man part.

But instant tell me, prophet, ow to serape 35
Returning wealth, and pile the splendid heap.

T. Ι told, and tell you: you may sasely catch

The wills of dotards, if you wisely watch3

And though one hunks or two perceive the cheat,
Avoid the hook, or nibble off the hait, 40
Lay not aside your golden hope of prey,

Or drop your art, though baffled in your play.

Should either great or less important suit
In court become the matter of dispute,

Espouse the man of prosperous affairs, 45
Pregnant with wealth. if indigent in heirs;
