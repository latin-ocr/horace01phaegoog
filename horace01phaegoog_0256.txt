244 nomen. ‘

H. Yes. 1 will hold the daring theme in view,
Perhaps hereaster your advice pursue. 2⁰
But Caesar never will your Flaccus hear;

A languid paneg-yric hurts his ear.
Too strongly guarded from the poet's lays,
He spurns the flatterer, and his saucy praise.

Τ. Better even this, than cruelly defame‚ 2⁵
And point buffoons and villains out by name.

Sure to be hated even by those you spate,
Who hate in Just proportion as they sear.

H. Tell me, TrebatiuS, are not all mankind
To different pleasureS, different whims inclinedz 30
Millonius dances when his head grows light,

And the dim lamp shines double to his sight.
The twin-born brothers in their sports divide ς
Pollux loves boxing3 Castor joys to ride.

Indulge me then in this my sole delight‚ 3‘5 ν

Like great and good Lucilius let me write.
Behold him frankly to his book impart,
As to a friend, the secrets of his beart:
To write was all his aim; too heedless hard,
And well or ill, unworth his regard. 40
Hence the old man stan s open to your view,
Though with a careless hand the iece he drew.
His ste s Ι follow in pursuit o fame,
Whether ucania or Apulia claim
The honour os my birth ; sor on the lands, 45
By Samnites once possess’d, Venusiam stands,
A forward barrier‚ as old tales relate,
To stop the course os war, and guard the state.
Let this digression, as it may, succeed—
No honest man shall by my satire bleed; 50
It guards me like a sword‚ and ease it lies
Within the sheath‚ till villains round me rise.
Dread king and father of the 'mortal race,

’ Behold me, harmless band, how fond os peace!

And may au kinds of mischief·making steel ⁶⁵
ln rust-,- etei-nal rust, thy vengeance feel!
