By eloquence their passions charm'd‚
By exercise their bodies form'd:
Han, winged messenger of Jove, 5
And all th’ immortal powers above,
Sweet parent os the bending lyre‚
Thy praise shall all its sounds inspire.
Artful and cunning to conceal
Whate’er in sportive thest you εῖτ-331, 10
When from the god, who 'gilds the pole,
Even yet a boy his herds you stole,
With angry voice the threat'ning power
Bade thee the fraudsul prey restore ;
But os his quiver too beguiled, 15
Pleased with the then, Apollo smiled.
You were the wealthy P'riam's guide
When sase from Agamemnon's pride,
Through hostile· campS, which round him spread
Their watchful fircS, his way he sped. 20

To blissful seats and joys divine,
And powersul with your golden wand
The light, unbodied crowd comma11d;
Thus grateful does your office prove · 25
To gods below, and gods above. ,
