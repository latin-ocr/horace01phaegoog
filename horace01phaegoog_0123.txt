Boon 111.—onn v'1. 111

With pliant limbs the tender maid
Now joys to leam the shameless trade 30
Of wauton dancing, and improves
'l'he pleasures os licentious loves;
Then soon amid the bridal feast
Boldly she courts her husband's guest3
Her love no nice distinction knOWS‚ 35
But round the wanderin pleasure throws,
Careless to hide thebol delight
In darkneSS, and the shades os night.
Nor does she need the thin disguise‚
The conscious husband bids her rise, 40
When some rich factor courts her (marma,
And calls the wauton to his ὅπως,
Thon, prodigal os wealth and same,
Prosusely buys the costly shame.

Not such the youth, os such a strain, 45
Who died with Punic gore the maim ·
Who Pyrrhus’ flying war pursued,
Antiochus the great subdued,
And taught that terror of the field,
The cruel Hannibal, to yield: 50
But a rough tace, inured to toil,
With heavy spade to turn the soil,
And, by a mother’s will severe,
To fell the wood‚ and homeward bear
The ponderous load, even when the sun 55
His downward course os light had run,
And from the western mountain’s head

‹ His changing shadows lengthening spread,

Unyoked the team, with toil oppress’d,

And gave the friendly hour os rest. 60
What feels not- time’s consuming ragel

More vicious than their fathers' age

Our sires begot the present race,

Of manners impiouS, bold, and base;

And yet, with crimes to us unknown, 65

Dur sons shall mark the coming age their own,
