When introduced, in few and salter-ing words
(Such as an infant modesty affords)
I did not tell you my descent was great, 75
Or that I wander'd round my country seat
On a proud steed in richer pastures bred;
But what Ι really waS, I frankly said.
Short was your answer‚ in your usual strain3
1 take my leave, nor wait on you again, ν 80
· Tin, nine months past, engaged and bid to hold
A place among your neuter friends enroll’d.
An honour this, methinks‚ os nobler kind,
'rhat innocent of heart and pure os mind,
Though with no titled birth, 1 gain'd his love, 85
Whose judgmeut ean disceim whose choice approve.
Is some few venial faults desorm my seul,
(Like a sair face when spotted with a mole,)
lf none with avarice justly brand my fame
With sordidness, or deeds too vile to name: 90
Is pure and innocent: is dear (forgive
These little praises) to my friends 1 live,
My father was the cause, wh0, though maintain’d
By a lean sarm but poorly‚ yet disdain’d
The country schoolmaster‚ to whose low care 95
The mighty captain sent his high-born heir,
With satchel‚ copy-book, and pell· to pay
The wretched teacher on th’ appointed day.
To Rome by this bold father was I brought,
'ro learn those arts which well-born youth are taught 3
So dress’d and so attended, you would swear 101
1 was some senator’s expensive heir;
Himsels my guardian, of unblemish'd truth‚
Among my tutors would attend my youth,
And thus preserved my chastity of mind, 105
(That prime of virtue in its highest kind‚)

93 This little episode. if it maybe so called, is of great beau·
Ἧ, and does much honour both to the father and son. It shows
t at greatness of sentimenta and goodness of beart are not· con·

fined to people of birth and fortune-San
