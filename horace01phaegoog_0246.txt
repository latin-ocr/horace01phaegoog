SATIRE IX.
Tan poet describes his 8υὲἕὲῐῇςὲ 1512)ae the loquacity of enimpot-

Musme‚ as went, on this and that,

Such trifles‚ as I know not what,

When late the street I saunter ’(1 through,

A wight‚ whose name 1 hardly knew,

Approaching pertly makes me stand, ’ 5

And thus accosts me, hand· m· hand: .
‘How do you (10, my sweetest manP’

Quoth1‚ “As well as mortal can,

And my best wishes yours' '——when he

Would follow—⁴⁶ What' s your will with me. ²” 10
“That one of your profound discerning

Should know me: 1 m a man of learningst -—
“Why then be sure upon that score

You merit my regard the more!

Impatient to discard the sup, 15

One while 1 run, another stop, ‘

And whisper, as he presses near,

Some nothing m my servant' s ear.
But while at every pore I sweated,

And thus in muttering silence frettet’l— 20
“aBol uS‚ ha ppy in a gscull

of pro s impenetrably dull,

011 for a portion os thy hrains ²”

He on the town and streete and lanes

His parting, praising talent tried, 25

And, whenl answered not, he cried,
“Ay‚ 'tis too plain; you ean 't’ deceive me,

You miserably wish to leave me;

But I shall never quit you 803

command me-whither would you gol-‘’²- 30

“ You do me honour—but, in short, ἡ

There’ s not the least occasion sor’t.
