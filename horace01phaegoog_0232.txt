220 nomen.

Pointing some awsul senator to view,
‘⁶ His grave example constantly pursue.”
Would he dissuade me; ‘⁴ Gan you doubt‚” he eries,
“ That equal ruin and dishonour rise 166
From such an action, when that scoundrel’s name
Is branded with the flagrant marks os shame 3⁹⁹
A neighbour's funeral, with dire affright‚
Checks the sick‘man's intemperate appetite3 170
So is the shame of others ost impress‘d
With wholesome terrors on the youthsul breast.

Thus, pure from more pernicious crimes 1 live:
Some venial frailties you may well forgive,
For such 1 own Ι have ς and yet even these, 175
A length os time, although by slow degi-ees,
A friend, whose candour freely may reprom,
Or my own reason, shall perhaps remove ;
For in my bed, or in the colonnade
Sauntering‚ Ι call reflection to my aid. 18⁰
“ This was well done. Here happiness attends.
'rhis conduct makes me pleasing to my friends.
Were that man’s actions os a beauteous kind ’ἐ
Oh! may 1 never be to such inclined !”

ThuS, silently 1 talk my conduct o'er, 185
Or trifle with the muse an idle hour3
. For which„among my frailtieS‚ 1 demand
Forgiveness‚ and shall call a powerful band,
Is you resuse‚ of poets to my aid,
(Well fraught with numbers is the rhyming trade,)
To force you like the proselyting Jews, 191
To be, like uS‚ a brother of the muse.

191 Horace knows not any better revenge sagainst the ene·
mies of poetry than to force them to become poete themselves.
This pleasant arises from the proselyting spirit of the Jews,
who insinua themselves into sanulles; entered into courts of
{affice ; disturbed the judge8‚ and were always more success-

in proportion as they were more impudent. Such iu tho
character given them by St. Ambroee.
