22 HORACE.

. Tempestuous‚ when the south descende
precipitata, and with the north contends;
Nor fear’d the stars portending rain, 15
Nor the loud tyrant of the western main,
of power supreme the storm to raise,
Or calmer smooth the surface of the sees,
’ What various forms of death could sright
The man, who view’d with fix'd‚ unshaken sight, 20
The floating monster-s waves iQamess,
And rocks, for shipwreck’d fleetS, ill famedl
Jove has the realms of earth in vain
Divided by th' inhabitable main,
If sh1ps profane, with fearless pride, 25
Bound o’er th’ inviolable tide. -
No laWS‚ or human or divine,
Can the presumptuous raee of man confine.
Thus from the sun's ethereal beam
When bold Prometheus stole th' enlivening name,
Of severs dire a ghastly brood, 31
Till then unknown, th’ unhappy fraud pursued3
On earth their horrors baleful spread,
And the pale monareh of the dead,
Till then slow-moving to his prey, 35
Preeipitately rapid swept his way.
Thus did the venturous Cretan dare
To tempt with impious wings the void of air3
Through hell Alcides urged his course:
No work too high sor mau's audacious force. 40
Our folly would attempt the skies‚
And with gigantis: boldness impious rise3
N or Jove, provoked by mortal pride,
Can lay his angry thunderbolts aside. ’
