ODE XV11.—'ro AELIUS LAMIA

Tu poet exhorta Lamia to spend the morrow, which threatens
to be dark and cloudy, with a liberal indulgence.

AEmus, whose ancient lineage springs

From Lamus, fou der of the name,
(From whom a sac ed line os kings

Shines through the long records os fame;

From whom th‘ illustrious race arose 5
Who first possess'd the Formian tenvem,
And reign’d where Liris smoothly flows
To fair Mariea’s marshy shores‚)

11· the old shower-foretelling crow*

Croak not her boding note in vain, 10
To-morrow’s eastern storm shall strow

The woods with leaves, with weeds the main.

'rhen pile the fuel while you may,
And cheer your spirit hi h with wine,

Give to your slaves one id e day, 15
And feast upon the fatted swine.

ODE XVIII.-·—TO FAUNUS.*
Honos prays that Faunus would be propitious to him.

Faunus, who with eager flame

Chase the nymphe, thy flying game,

Is a tendet kid distain‚

Each returning year, thy sane,

Is with wine we raise the soul, · 5
(Social Venus loves the bowl,)
