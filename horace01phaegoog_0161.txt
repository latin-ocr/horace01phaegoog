Or as a lion through the forest stalks‚

Wean'd by his tawny dam from milky sood3 20
A goat descries him from her flowery walks‚

First doom'd to stain his youthsul jaws with blood:
So Drusus look'd tremendous ‘to his toea,
Beneath the stozen height os Alpine snows.

The Rhoetian hands beheld him such in war, 25
Those daring bande, who with triumphant joy

Were wont to spread their banesul terror-s far,
Tamed by the conduct os the martial boy,

Felt what true contage could achieve when led

By bright example, and by virtue bred; 30

Felt how Augustus with paternal mind
Fired the young Neros to heroic deeds—
The brave and good are copies os their kind:
In steers laboriouS, and in generous steeds
We trace their sires; nor can the bird os Jove 35
Intrepid‚ fiel-ce, beget th' unwarlike dove.

Yet sage instructions to refine the soul,

And raise the geniu8‚ wondrous aid impart,
Conveying‚ inward as they purely roll,

Strength to the mind, and vigour to the heart: 40
When morals fail, the stains of vice disgrace
The sairest honours, aud the noblest race.

How much the grandeur os thy risin state
Owes to the Netos, Rome imperia , say;

mother was married to Au stus. In this manner the emperor
was a woond father to the Netos.
