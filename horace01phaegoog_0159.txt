oDE 111.—To MELPOMENE.*

§Iouna attributes his place and rank among poeta to tho favour
of Melpomene.

Ha, on whose natal hour the queen
Os verse hath smiled, shall never grace
The Isthmian gauntlet‚ or be seen
Firat in the samed Olympio race: ,
He shall not aster toils oswar, 6
And taming haughty monarchs' pride,
With laurell'd brows conspicuous far,
To Jove’s Tarpeian temple ride : ,
But him, the streams which warbling flow
Rich Tibur's fertile vales along, 10
And shady groveS‚ his haume, shall know
The master os th’ AEolian song.
The sons os Rome, majestic Rome!
Have placed me in the poet's quire,
And envy, now or dead or dumb‚ 13
Forbears to blame what they admira.
Goddcss of the sweet-sounding lute,
Which thy harmonious touch obey8‚
Who canat the finny race, though mute,
To cygnet’s dying accents raise, 20
Thy gift it ia, that all, with ease,
Me prince os Roman lyrics own;
That while I live my numbers please,
Is pleasing, is thy gift alone.

21 'I'he praises which Horace gives himself in thia ode are
happily tempered by his acknowledgments that all hia poetical
abilitles are a present from the muses. We should allow some·
tlung i'or this instance of modesty. because it is not usually a
favourite virtue among poeta—San.
