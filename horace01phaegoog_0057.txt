Plaee me where never summer breeze
Unbinds the leba, or warms the trees3
Where ever· owen-ing clouds appear,

And angry Jove deforms th’ inclement year: 20

Canon flies me like a fawn,

Which through some sequester’d lawn

Panting seeks the mother deer,

Not without a panio sear

Of the gently breathing breem, 6
And the motion of the trees.

Frighted- it be ' s to sreeze,

Trembling bot at heart and knees. 10

Nor a lion, fraught with ire,

Like as a hind—
Yet flies away, of her own feet affear'd ;
And every leaf that shaketh with the least
Murmur of wind, her terrour hath encreast.
