266 HORACE·

In thirsty fields a richer colewort grows
Thau where the watery garden overflows.
If by an evening guest perchance surprised‚

Lest the tough hen (I pray you be advised)
Should quarrel with his teeth‚ let her be drown’d 25

In lees of wine, and she'll be tender found.
Best flavour'd mushrooms meadow land supplies,
In other kinds a dangerous poison lies.

He shall with vigour bear the summer's heat,
Who aster dinner shall be sure to eat 30
His mulberries, of blackest‚ ripest dies,

And gather‘d ere the morning sun arise.

Aufidius first, most injudiciouS, quafl’d

Strong wine and honey for his morning draught.
With lenient beverage fill your empty wine, 35
And smoother mead shall better scour the reins.
Sorrel and white wine, if you costive prove,

And muscIeS, all obstructions shall remove.

In the new moon all shell-fish fill with juice;

But not all seas the richer sort produce ; 40
The largest in the Lucrine lake we find,

But the Circaean are of sweeter kind.

Crayfish are best on the Misenian coasts,

And soft Tarentum broadest scollops boasts.

If not exact and elegant of taste, 4⁵

Let none presume to understand a feast.

’Tis not enough to buy the precious fish,

But know what sauce gives flavour to the dish,

If stew’d or roasted it shall relish best,

And to the table rouse the languid guest. 50

If the hals-tainted flesh of boars you hate,

Let the round dishes bend beneath the weight

33 Marcus Aufidius Lurco was a man extremely knowmg in
the science of ood eating. Our doctor adventurer here hazards
a decision wit his usual spirit. Aufidius invented a morning
draught of strong wine mixed with honey, to fortisy the stomach
and promote digestion. Catius gleasantly steals the honour of
this invention from him, and con emns the custom m Aufidius
even while he recommends it himself.
