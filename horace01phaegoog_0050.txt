In arms superior to his sire, 35·
Burrus after thee with martial fire.
,As when a stag at distance spies
A prowling wolf, aghast he fiies,
of pastui-e heedless‚ so shall you,

Not such the promises you made,

ODE xvh-'ro TYNDAR18.*

Houcn attempts to appease Tyndaris, after having lampeoned
her mother Gratidia.

Daremma, whose lovelirsess the bosom warms
More than thy lovely mother's riper charmS,
Give to my bold lampoons what fate you please‚

But yet remember, nor the god os wine, , 5
Nor Pythian Phoebus, from his inmost shrine,

Nor Dindymene, nor her priests possess'd‚

Can with their sounding cymbals shake the breast,

Like furious anger in its glo'omy vein,

Which neither temper’d sword, nor raging main,
N οι· fire wide-wasting‚·nor tremendous Jove, · ll

verses on Gratidia, but being now in love with her daughter, he
