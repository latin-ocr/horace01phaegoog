And now to birds and thieves I stand
ἵ A tenor great. With ponderous hand,
And something else as red as scarlet, χ
1 fri ht away each filching varlet.' 10
TheffiitdS, that view with awsul dread ἡ
*rho teeds, fast stuck into my head,
Fa'r from the gai-den take their ssight,
Nor on the trees presume to light.

In coffins vile the herd os slaves 15
Were hither brought to crowd their gravem
And once in this detested ground

, Α common tomb the vulgar souud.;
Buffoons and spendthristS, vile and base, .
Together rotted here in peace. 20
A thousand feet the sront extends,
'I'htee hundred deep in rear it bends,
And yonder column plainly shows
No more unto its heire it goes.
But now we breathe a puter air, 2⁸
And walk the sunny terrace sair,
Where once the ground with bones was white,
With human bonae, a ghastly sight!

But, oh! nor thies, nor aava‘ge beant,

That used these gardens to intest, ao
E’er gave me half such cares and paim

As they, who turn poor people's hrains

With venom’d druge and magio lay— ’

These I can never fright away3 „

For when the beauteous queen of night 35
Uplifts her head adorn’d‘ with light,

Hither they come, pernicious eronee!

To gather poisouous herba and bones,

Canidia with dishevell'd hair,

(Black was her robe, her feet were bare.)j 40
With Sagana, infernal dame!

Her etder sister, hither came.

With yellings dire they fill’d the place,

And hideous pale was either's sace.
