ODE lv.—'ro CALLIOPE.

Tun poet dasenbes the happiness of those who are under tho
protection of the gods. ,

“ Dascnnn from heaven, and in a lengthen’d strain,

Queen of melodious soundS‚ the song sustain3

Or on the voice high-raised, the breathing θυῖε,

The lyre of golden tone, or sweet Phoebean lute.
Hark! some celestial voice Ι raptured hear! 5

Or does a leasing phrensy charm my ear!

Through llow'd groves 1 stray, where streame

beneath
From kl)u‹:idh sountains ssew, and zephyr-s balmy
reat e. '

Fatigued with sleep, and youthsul toil of play,

When on a mountain's brow reclined I lay lo

Near to my natal soil, around my head

The sabled woodland doves a verdant foliage spread:
Mamer, be sure, of wonder most profound

To all the gazing habitants around,

Who dwell in Acherontia's airy glandes, 15
Amid the Bantian woods, or low Forentum's mead83
By snakes os poison black, and beasts os prey‚

That thuS, in dewy sleep, unharm'd Ι lay;
Laurels and myrtle were around me piled,
Not without guardian gods an animated child. 20

. 9 Horace endeavours to persuade hie friends, by the miracles
which the muses performed in his favour when he was a boy,
that all this agreeable prospect is real. He begins, therefore,
to number the benefits for whlch he was indebted to them, and
thus insensibly proceeds to speak os the pardon which he had
received b their means. He proposes hlmself as the first ex·
⁴ample of t ιτ protection, from whence he rises to their affec-
t10n and care for Augustus—Dae. San.

15 Horace calls Acherontis a nest, because it was situated
on rocks, on the frontiers of Lucania. Cicero says of Ulysses‚
‘⁸ so owerful ιε the love of our country, tha't the wisest of the
Grpesss preferred his Ithaca, fixed like a nest on‘rookn, to the
enjoyment of mmortahtyfl—*Daa
