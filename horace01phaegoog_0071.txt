BOOK 1.-—·0D1·2 XXXVI. 59

Alas! the shameless sears! the guilty deeds‚
When by a brother’s hand a brother bleeds!

What crimes have we, an iron age, no't daredl 35
ln terror of the gods what altar sparedt

Oh! that our ,swords with civil gore distain’d‚
And in the sight of gods and men profaned—
n again, dread queen, the blunted steel‚

{lgm our foes the pointed vengeance feel. 40

ODE XXXVI!

Hono: congratulates Numida on his happy return from Spain.

Wrrn incense heap the sacred fire,
And bolder strike the willing lyre.
Now let the heiser’s votive blood
Pour to the gods its purple fiood3
Those guardian gods, from farthest Spain, 5
Who send our Numida again.
A thousand kisses now he gives,
A thousand kisses he receives,
But Lamia most his friendship proves;
Lamia with tendemess he loves, 10
At school their youthsul love began,
Whenee they together rose to man.
With happiest marks the day shall shine‚ ’
Νοι· want th’ abundant joy os wine3

Numida returned with Augustus from the war of S ain; and
