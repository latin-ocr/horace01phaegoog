But who provokes me, or attacks my same,
“ Better not touch me, friend‚'’ 1 loud exolaim;
His eyes shall weep the folly os his tongue,
By laughing erowds in ruesul ballad sung. 60
Th’ informer Cervius threatens with the laws3
Turius your judge‚ you surely lose your cause ε
Are you the obJect of Canidia's hate}
DrugS, poison& incantatione, are your sate:
For powersul nature to her creaturos shows 65

The wolf with teeth, the bull with horns ean fight3
Whenee, but from instinct, and an inward lightz
His lon -lived mother trust to Seaeva's care—
T. No eed os blood his pious hand could dare. 70
H. Wondrous indeed ! that bulls ne’er strive to bite,
Nor‘wolves, with desperate horns engage in sight 3

But with a draught os honey'd poison kills.

And short thy days. Some lord shall strike thee dead,
With sreezing look— H. What! in ·his honest page
When good Lucilius lash’d a vicious age,
From eonscious villains tore the mask away,
And stripp’d thern naked to the glare os day,
Were Laelius or his friend, (whose glorious name 85
From conquer'd Carthage deathless rose to fame,)
Were they displeased‚ when villains and their crimes
Were eover’d o'er with insamy and rhyniest
The factious demagogue he made his prae,
And durst the people tribe by tribe chastis03 90
Yet true to virtue, and to virtue’s friend8‚
'ro them alone with reverenee he bends.
When Scipio’s virtue, and, of milder vein,
When Laelius’ wisdom,2{rom the busy soene„
