242 nomen.

Let me, with no mean arts to purchase fame,
Rollin, Messala, and his brother name:

Let Bibulus and Servius be my own,

And Furnius for a critic’s candor known; 12⁰
Among my learned friends are many more,

whose names Ι pass in modest silence o‘er;

These I can wish to smile; enj0y their praise5
Hope to delight‚ and grieve is 1 displease.

Be gone, Demetrius, to thy lovesome train. 125
Os minstrel scholam, and in sighing suain,

with soft Hermogenes these rhymes deplore—
Haste, buy, transcribe me this one satire more.
