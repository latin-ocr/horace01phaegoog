ODE xl1.—-'1·o MAECENAS.

Ηοιωι acknowledges that he wan oo given up to Licymnia
that he was unable to riae to more serious subjecto.

Nuumu’s ware, for years maintain'd,
Or Hannibal's vindictive ire,
Or seas with Punic gore distain'd,
Suit not the eoftness of my feeble lyre;

Nor savage centem-8, mad with wine, ὁ
Nor earth's ' antio rebel brood,
Who shook ol aturn's seat divine,
'rill by the arm of Hercules eubdued.

You in historic prose shall tell
The mighty power of Caesar’s war ; 10
How kin beneath his battle fell,
Or dragg’d in ignant his triumphal car.

Licymnia’s dulcet voice, her eye,
Bright-darting its resplendent ra ‚
Her bremt, where love and friends 'p lie, 15
The muse commende me sing in sotter lay3

In raillery the eportive jeet‚
Graceful her mien in dancing eharms,
When layful at Diana's feast
'l'o the brig t virgin choir she winde her arma. 20

Sag, shall the wealth b kings poesesb’d, ⁴
r the rich diadems t ey wear,

Or all the treasures of the East‚
Purchase one look of my Licymnia's hair!
