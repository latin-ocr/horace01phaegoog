20 ⁸ - HoRAoE.

With grief and rage while Ilia’s bosom glows‚
Boastful, for her revenge, his waters rose;

But now th‘ uxorious river glides away,
So Jove commandS, smooth-winding to the sea. 20

And yet, less numerous by their parents’ crimen,
Our sons shall hear, shall hear to latest times,
Of Roman arms with civil gore imbrued‚

Which better had the Persian foe subdued.

Among her guardian gods, what pitying power 25
To raise her sinking state shall Rome imploress
Shall her own hallow'd virginsss’ earnest prayer
Harmonious charm offended Vesta's ear?

To whom shall Jove assign to purge away

The guilty need! Come, then, bright god of day, 30
But gracious veil thy shoulders beamy might,

Oh! veil in clouds th' insufferable light.

Or come, sweet queen of smileS, while round thee
On xvahct’gg’wing, the powers of mirth and love;

Or hither, Mars, thine aspect graeious bend, 3⁵
And powerful thy neglected race defend.

Parent of Rome, amid the rage of fight

sated with soenes of blood, thy fierce delight,
Thou, whom the polish'd helm, the noise of eume,
And the stern soldier's frown with transport warmse

Or thou, fair Maia’s winged son appear, 41

· And human shape, in prime os m-anhood‚ weam

Declared the guardian os th· imperial state,
Divine avenger of great Caesar‘s fate:

Oh! late return to heav'n‚ and may thy reign 4⁵
With lengthen’d blessings fi-ll thy wide dothain!
Nor let thy people‘s crimes provoke th flight,

On air swfft rising to ,the ,realrns ‚of lig . t..
