And left to boars and wolves the sacred fane,
With all their household gods, adored in vain,
So let us fiy, as far as earth extende, 25
Or where the vagi-ant wind our voyage bends.
Shall this, or shall some better scheme prevail!
Why do we stop to hoist the willing,sai13
But let us swear‚ when floating rocks shall gain,
Raised from the deep, the surface os the maim 30
When lowly Po the mountain summit laves,
And Apennine shall plunge beneath the waves;
When nature’s monsters meet in strange delight‚
And the fell ἐἰει-688 shall with stags unite3 >
When 1116 fierce kite shall woo the willing dove, 35
And win the wauton with adulterous love;
When herds on brindled lions fearless gaze,
And the smooth goat exults in briny seas;
Then‚ and then only, to the tempting· gale,
To spread repentant the returning sail. 40
Yet to cut off our hopes—those hopes that charm
Our fondless home—let us with curses arm
These high resolves. Thus 161 1116 brave and wisc,
Whose souls above th’ indocile vulgar rise:
'rhen let the crowd, who dare not hope success, 45
In 10110118, 111686 ill-omen'd seats possess.

For earth-surrounding sea our ssight 8118118,
Offering its blissful 18168, and happy seats, 50
Where annual Ceres crowns th’ uncultured field,
And vines unpruned their blushing clusters yield;
Where olives», faithful to their season‚ row,
And figs with nature’s deepest purple g ow ς.
From hollow oaks where honey'd streame distil, ⁵5
