Speak what you think. We here our rights resign.

S. Greatest of monarchs‚ may the powers divine

A safe return permit you to enj0y,

With your victorious fieet from ruin’d Troy!

But may 1 ask and answer without sear ἒ

A. Yotli1 may. S. Then wherefore rots great Ajax
ere, 270

For many a Grecian saved who well· might claim

To brave Achilles the next place in famei

Is it that Priam, and the sires of Troy,

May view his carcass with malignant joy,

By whom their sons so oft destroy’d in fight 275

In their own country· want the funeral rite ἒ

A. A thousand sheep the frantie kill’d and cried,

‘⁶ Here both Atrides ξ th⁸ere mysses died.”

S. When our own child ou to the altar led,

And pour' the salted me upon her head3 280

. When you beheld the lovely victim slain‚

Uunatural father! were you sound of brairi!

A. Why nott S. Then what did frantie Ajax do,

When in his rage a thousand sheep he slew}

Nor on his wife or son he drew his sword, 285

On Atreus' sons alone his curses pour'd;

Nor on his brother turned the vengeful steel,

Nor did mysses his resentment feel.

A. But Ι, while adverse winds tem stuous roar,

To loose our fated navy from the s ore 290

Wisel with blood the powers divine atone—

8. at! your own blood, you madman! A. YeS,

m own;

But yet {ot mad. S. ’Tis a disorder'd head,

Which, by the passione in confusion led,

The images of right and wrong mistakes, 295

And rage or folly no great difference makes.

Was Ajax mad when those poor lambs he slew ἓ
And are your senses right, while you pursue
With such a crime an empty title’s fame?

Is the heart pure, high-swelhng for a namet 300
