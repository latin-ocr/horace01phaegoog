HORACE·

To him, who with dissembled fears,
ConsciouS, the Roman arms reveres3
To him, who drinks the rapid Rhone,

Shall Horace, deathless bard! be known.

My friendS, the funeral sorrow sparo,
Tho plaintive song, and tender tear3
Nor let tho song os grief profane

³ l With loud laments the- solemn scen03

Nor o’er your poet's empty urn
With useless, idle sorrows mourn.
