124' nomen.

Poseees’d os what the great despice,

In real. richer pompl rice,

Thau is, from sair Apulia’e plain, 35
1 stored in heape the various grain,

While, of the wealthy mass secure,

Amid the rich abundance poor.

The streamlet‚ flowing through my ground3
The wood, which a few acres bound3 40
The little farm os kindly soil,

Nor suithlese to its master’e teil,

Shall tell the consul, whoee domuin

Extende o'er Afric’e fertile plain,

Though of his envied lot possess’d‚ 45
He ne’er shall be like Horace bleee'd.

Though nor the samed Calabrian bee

Collects ite golden sweets sor me;
For me no For-mian vintage grown,
With mellow'd warmth where Bacchus ssows3 50
Nor on the verdant Gallie mead
My flocks of richer fleeces seed:
Yet am Ι not with want oppress’d‚
Which vainly seelrs the port os rest,
· Nor would thy bounteoue hand deny 55
My larger wishes to ευρῖἰγς
But while those wishes restrain,
‚ Farther 1 stretch my small domain
Thau could Ι distant kingdoms jein,
And make united empires mine; 60
For sure the state of man is such,
They greatly want who covet much:
'I'hen happy he, whom Heaven bath fed
With frugal, but sufficient bread.

38 Nothing ie more common than this poverty in the midst
of abundance. In some it proceeds from everice, m othere
from prodigality‚ while he who is conteuted with a moderate
fortune known not either of these contrary excessu, which
render the miser and the prodigal equally wretched—San.
