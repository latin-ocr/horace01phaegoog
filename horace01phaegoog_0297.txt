SATIRE VIII.

Hmuon in this satire presents us with a humorous descrip-
tion of a miser’s entertainment.

Horace. 'Puer told me, that you spent the jovial night
With N asidienuS, that same happy wight, ’
From early day, or you had been my guest ;
But, prithee, tell me how you liked your feast.
Fundcznius. Snre never better. H. Tell me, if you
p ease, 5
How did you first your appetite appeasel
F. First a Lucanian boar of tendet kind,
Caught, says our host, in a soft, southern wind.
Around him lay whatever could excite,
With pungent force, the jaded appetite, 10
RapeS‚,lettuee, radishes, anehovy-brine,
With skerretS, and the lees of Coan wine.
This dish removed, a slave expert and able
With purple napkin wiped a maple table. -
Another sweeps the fragments os the feast, 1⁵ Α ,
That nothing useless might offend the guest. - ¹ ν “
At Ceres’ feast as Attio virgin walks
Solemn and slow, so black Hydaspes stalks
With right Caeeubian, and the wines of Greece—
Of foreign growth, that never cross'd the seaS. 20
If Alban and Falernian please you more,
So says our host, you may have both good store;
Poor wleaIth indeed— H. But tell me, who were
t ere,

Thus happy to enjoy such luscious fare}
F. On the first bed Thurinus lay between 25
Varius and me, is happily right I ween;
Servilius and Vibidius both were there,
Brought by MaecenaS, and with him they share
·'I'he middle bed. Our master os the feast
On the third conch, in seat of honour placed, 30
Porcius betwixt and Nomentanus lies;
Porcius, who archly swallows eustard pies.
