' BOOK 1.—-sA·r1R1³: 1. 207

But mark his sate, insatiate who desii-es

Deeper to drink than nature’s thirst requires; 70
With its torn banks the torrent bears away

'rh‘ intemperate wretch; while he, who would allay
With healthy draughts his thirst, shall drink secure,
Fearless os death, and quaff his water pure.

Some, sels-deceived‚ who think their lust of gold 75

Is but a love of same, this maxim hold, “

No fortune’s large enough, since others rate

Your worth proportion’d to a large estate.

With open mouth when dosing o’er your gold. 90

Whose hallow’d stores must never be defiled

'I'o human use; while you transported gaze,

As is, like pictur-ee, they were sorm’d to please. ,

Would you the real use of riches know ἓ 95
Bread, herbe, and wine are all they can bestow-
Or add, what nature's deepest wants supplies; j
This, and no more, thy mass of money buys.
But, with continual watching almost dead,
House-breaking thieveS‚ and midnight fires to dread,
Or the suspected slave’s untimely flight 101
With the dear pels ς is this be thy delight,
Be it my fate, so Heaven in bounty please,
Stil} to be poor os blessings such as these!

M. If, by a cold some painsul illness bred‚ 106

Or other chance confine you to your bed,
