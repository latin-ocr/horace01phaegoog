In horr-id pomp os war the soldier dies3
The sailor m the greedy ocean lies;
Thus age and youth promiscuous crowd the tomb: ξ
Νο mortal head can shun th’ impending doom. 26
When sets Orion’ s star, the wind8‚ that sweep N
The raging waves‚ o ’erwl’ielm’d me in the deep: J
Nor thou, my friend, resuse with impious hand f
A little portion of this wandel-ing sand 30 ·
To these my poor remain83 so may the storm
Rage 0 ’er the woodS, nor ocean’ s face deform.
Μ3ἔ11 gracious Jove with wealth thy toils repay‚ <
Neptune guard thee through the watery way.
hyguiltless racc this bold neglect shall mourn, J
And thou shalt feel the just returns of scorn- 36 ί
My curses shall pursue the guilty deed,
And 311, 111 vain, thy richest victims bleed. ‘2
Whate’ er thy haste, oh! let my prayer prevail‚ ’-
-Thrice strow the saud, then hoist the flying sail. 40 ξ

should be thrice thrown on 311 unburied body.— —Torn Dac.
