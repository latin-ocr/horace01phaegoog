noox n.-u'1·1u 11. 247

come leam with me, but learn before γε dine, ⁵

Ere with luxurious pomp the table shine; .

Ere yet its madding splendours are display'd‚

That dull the sense, and the weak mind mislead.

Yet why before we dine 3 I’ll tell γε, friends, .

A judge‚ when bribed‚ but ill to truth attentis· 10
Pursue the chase: th’ unmanaged courser rein:

Or, if the Roman war ill suit thy vein,

To Grecian revels sorm’d, at tennis play,

Or at the manly discus waste the ‘da ;

With vigour hurl it through the yiel ing air; 1⁵

(The sport shall make the labour less severe ς)

, Then‚ when the loathings that from surfeits rise

Are quell’d by teil, a hemely meai despise;
Then the Falerni-an grape with pride disclaim‚
Unless with honey we correct «its flame. 20
Your butler strolls abroad; the winter'd sea
Defends its fleh3 but you can well allay
The stomach’s angry roar with bread and salt.
Whence can this rise, you ask, from whence the faulss
In you consists the pleasure of the treat, 25
Not in the price, or flavour os the meat.
Let exercise give relish to the* dish,
Since nor the various luxuries of fish,
Nor foreign wild sowl can delight the pale,
Surfeit·swoln guest3 yet I shall ne’er. prevail 30
To make our men os taste a pullet choose‚ “
And the gay peacock with its train resuse3
For the rare bird at mighty price is sold ;
And, lo ! what wonders from its tail unsold!
