Thence onward labouring with a world of pain, 35
At ten, Feronia, we thy fountain gain3
There land and bathe 3 then after dinner creep '
Three tedious miles, and climb the rocky steep
Whence Anxur shineS. Maecenas was to meet
Cocceius here, to settle things os weight3 40
For they had oft in embassy been join’d,
And reconciled the masters of mankind.
Here while Ι bathed my eyes with cooling ointment
They both arrived according to appointment3
Fonteius too, a man os worth approved, 45
And no man more by Antony beloved.
Laughing we leave an entertainment rare,
The paltry pomp of Fundi’s soolish may’r,
The scrivener Luscus: now with pride elate,
With incense sumed, and big with robes of state. 50
From thence jour wearied troop at Formiae rests, ' ³
Murena’s lodgerS, and Fonteius’ guests·
Next rising rnorn with double joy. we greet‚
For Plotius, Vax-ine, Vir-gil here we meet:
Pure spirits these3 the world no pur-er knows; ⁴ 55
For none my heart with more affection glows:
How ost did we embrace! our joys how great!
For sure no blessing in the power os fate ·
Can be compared, in sanity of mind,
To friends os such companionable kind. 6⁰
N ear the Campanian bridge that night we laY,
Where commissaries our expense defray.
Early next morn to Capua we came;
Maecenas goes to tennis; hurtful game
To a weak stomach, and to tender eyes, η 65
So down to sleep with Virgil Horace lies.
Then by Cocceius we were nobly treated, ·
Whose house above the Caudian tavern’s seated.
And now, oh muse! in faithful numbers tell
The memorable squabble that besell, 70

69 This little scene ,is of much natural pleasanty, mitet!
by a spirited ridicule. The poet invokes bis muso ναῶ much
