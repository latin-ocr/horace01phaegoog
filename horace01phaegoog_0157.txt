As when a river, swoln by sudden showers‚ 6
O'er its known banks from some steep mountain
urs3
So in plssfound unmeasurable song
The decomouth’d Pindar, sowing, pours along.
Well he deser-ves Apollo's laurell'd crown;
Whether new words he rolls enraptured down 10
Impetuous through the dithyrambic strainS,
Fron from all laws but what himself ordains:
'Whether in losty tone sublime he sings
The immortal gods, or god-descended kings‚
With death deserved who smote the centaurs dire, 15
And quench’d the fierce Chimera’s breath of fire;
Or whom th’ Olympic palm, celestial prize !
victorious crowns‚ and raises to the skies‚
Wrestler or steed—with honours, that outlive
The morta] fame which thousand statues give : 20
Or mourns some hapless youth in plaintive lay,
me his fond, we ing bride, ah! torn away3
His manners purefh'is courage, and his name,
Snatch’d from the grave, he vindicates to fame.
