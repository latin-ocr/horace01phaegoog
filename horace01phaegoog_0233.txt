SATIRE V.

Honos, with great fllgffffi' fflfflbllessa joumey of his from

Lumo impe-rial Rome, my course 1 steer
To poor Aricia, and its moderate cheer.

ι From all the Greeks, in rhetorieian lore,

The prize of. learning my c mpanion bore.

To Forum-Appii thence we teer, a place 5
Stuff’d with rank boatmen‚ and with vintners base,
And laggard into two days’ journey broke

What were hutone to less eneumber'd folk3

The Appian mad, however, yields most pleasure
To those who choose to travel at their leisure. 10
The water here was os so foul a stream,

Against my stomaeh Ι a war proclam,

And wait, though not with much good-humour wait,
While with keen appetites my comrades ate.

The night o’er earth now spread her dusky shade,

*And through the heavens her starry train display’d3 15
What time, between the slaves and boatmen rise
Quarrels of elamorous tout. The boatman eries,

“ Step in, my masters ;” when with open throat‚

‘⁴ Enough‚ you scoundrel! will you sink the boat 3⁹⁹ 20
Thus, while the mule is harness’d‚ and we pay κ
Our sreights‚ an honr in wrangling slips away.

The fenn srogs with croakihgs hoarse and deep,
And gnats‚ oud buzzin , drive away our sleep.
Drench’d in the lees o wine, the wat'ry swain, 25
And passenger‚ in lond alternate strain
Chant forth the absent sair, who warms his breast
Till wearied passenger retires to rest.

Oui· elumsy bargoman sends his mule to grue,
And the tough eable to a rock belays; 30
Then snores supine; but when at rising light

Our boat stood still, upstarts a hair-brain’d wight; . f ›-
With §allow eudgel breaks the bargeman’s pate, πῖ 2 ‚4- 2

And ba'nsss the mule at ἂι, well favour'd rate.
