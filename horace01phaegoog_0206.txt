Or mix the speedy drugs in vainl
No-through a lingering length of pain,
Reluctant shalt thou drag thy dayS‚ 15
While every hour new pangs shall raise.

Which cl rms his eye, yet flies his taste‚
Perfidiou Tantalus imploreS,

For rest,¹ or rest, the vengesul powers; 20
PrometheuS‚ while the vulture preys

Upon his livet, longs for ease 3

And Sisyphus, with many a groan‚
Upr011s‚ with ceaseless toil‚ his stone,

To fix it on the topmost hill, 25
In vain, for Jove’s all-ruling will
Forbids. When thus in black despair
Down from some castle5‘ high in air,
You seek a headlong sate below,
Or try the dagger’s pointed blnw, 30
Or ir the lest-ear'd knot you tie,
Yet death your vain attempts shall fly3
Then on your shoulders will Ι ride,
And earth shall shake beneath my pride
Could I with lise an image warm, 3⁶
(Impertineut‚ you saw the charm,)
,Or tear down Luna from her skies,
Or bid the dead, though burn'd‚ arise,
Or mix the draught inspiring love,
And shall my art on thee suocessless prove 3 4⁰
