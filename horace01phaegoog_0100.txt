And vvarm the song with Grecian fire;

Then scum, in consciens virtue proud,

The worthless maline of the crowd.

ODE xva—To· MAEOENAS.*

Houct comforts Maecena· labouring under 3 fover, and denies
that he can possibly survive him.

er will Maecenas thus complainl
Why kill me with the tendet strain!
Nor can the gods, nor 1 consent
That you, my life’s great ornament,
Should sink untimely to the tomb‚ 5
While 1 survive the fatal doom,
Should you, alas! be snatch'd away,
Wheresore, ah! wherefore should 1 stay,
My value lost, no longer whole,
And but possessing half my sculi 10
One day (believe the sacred cath)
811311 lead the funeral pomp of both:
With thee to Pluto’s dark ab0d03
With thee I’ll tread the dreary read,
Nor fell Chimaera’s breath of fare, 15
Nor hundred-handed Gyas dire,
Shall ever tear my friend from me;
So justice and the fates decrec.
