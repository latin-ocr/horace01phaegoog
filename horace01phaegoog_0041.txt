ODE IX.-'1·o THALIARCHUS!

Holmon exhorta Thaliarchua ιο pass the winter with gayety.

Btnotn Soracte's airy height,
See how it stands a heap of snow;
Behold the winter-'s hoary weight
oppress the labouring woods below3
And by the season’s icy hand ⁶
Congeal’d‚ the lazy rivers stand.

Now melt away the winter's cold‚
And larger {nie the cheerful fire3
Bring down t e vintage four years old,
Whose mellow’d heat can mirth inspire3 10
Then to the guardian owers divine
Careless the rest osli e resign;

ἕ Horace in thia ode aeta forth all hia Epicurean hilo-oph„

spring. and heat of summer3 the ri neas of autumn, and cold-
ness os winter, have their seve engagementa to ΔρΙοεέιιῐοι.
This ode waa probably written at a country seat of Thaliarchua,
near the mountain Soracte in Tuscany, aix-,and-twanty ,milen
from Korne—Dae.

E icurean ridicule on the doctrine of the stoice, who asserted
a 'vine Providence even in events most inconsiderahie. They
think the poet has raised his style with an affected pom of ex-
pression, to render hia ridicule more strong. 'rhat w en the
gods have commanded the raging of the winda ιο cease, all the
wondrous effecta of their power shall be, that the woods shall
stand unahaken. On the contrary‚‹there seems to be something
just and noble in the -thought, when taken in a moral aenae,
and which might naturally raiae thia greatneas of ex reunion ·
that when the gods have appeased the winda, not a eas ahali
fall ιο the ground3 and even trees decayed and aplos· with
age, ‚shall stand unshakan. Such i· the care and power οἱ
