What joys‚ what glories round him wait
Who bravely for his country dieS‚
While with dishonest wounds shall fate 15
Relentless stab the coward as he flies!

With stainless lustre' virtue shineS‚
A base repulse, nor knows‚ nor fears 3
Nor claims her honourS‚ nor declines,
As the light air of crowds uncertain veers; ΒΟ

To him, who not deserves to die,
She shows the paths which heroes trod, ’
Then bids him boldly- tempt the. sky,
Spurn off his mortal clay, and rise a god.

To silence due rewards we give, ¹ 25
And they, who myster-ies reveal‚
Beneath my roos shall never live,
Shall never hoist with me the doubtful sail.

When Jove in anger strikes the blow‚

, Ost with the bad the righteous bleed: 30

Yet with sure stepS, though lame and slow‚
Vengeance o'ertakes the trembling villain's speed.

26 He who discovered the mysteries of Ceres was driven out
from the society of humankind, and detested as a wretch un·

dangerous to converse with him, lest Jupiter in his anger
should confound the innocent with the guilty. The Greeks not
only punished with death the person who revealed these mys·
series, but even those who listened to them—Dae.
