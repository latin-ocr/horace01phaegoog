This day at least your griess restrain,
And luckless from ill-omen’d words abstain.

This day, with truly sestal j0y‚
Shall drive all gloorny cares away, 20

Nor sear of death from foreign arms,
Nor civil rage my dauntless soul alarms.

Bo ‚ bring us essentne, bring us crowns; 25
ierce me a cask os ancient date,
Big with thestorbd Mai-sian war,
And with its glorious deeds replete,
Is yet one jovial cask remam,

And bid the fan· one haste to bind
In careless wreaths-her essenced hain
But should her porter bid you stay, ³⁵
Loave the mogh, sut-ly rogue, and come away.

W‘hen hoary age upon our heads
Poura down its chilling weight of eumve,
No more the breast with anger burna,
No more with amorous heat it glows: 40

When warml wilt1h youth, when Plancus fill'd the
consu ’s c air.

Philippi was fought, where our t appeared in the etune of .
liberty, and was a tribune under tum-Bona„ Α
