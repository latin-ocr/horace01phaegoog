While nobly conscious of unsullied fame,
Fair honour dreads th’ imputed sense of blame. 30

By thee our wedded dames are pure
From foul adultery's embrace3
The conscious father views secure
His own resemblance in his tace:
Thy chaste exam le quells the spotted deed‚ 35
And to the guilt t y punishments succeed.

Who shall the saithless Parthian dread,
The sreezing armies os the north,
The enormous outh, to battle bred,
Whom horri Germany brings forth! 40
Who shall regard the war os cruel Spain,
Is Caesar live secure, is Oaesar reign}

Safe in his vineyard toils the hind‚
Weds to the widow'd clm his vine,
Till the sun sets his hill behind; 45
Then hastens joyful to his wine,
And in his gayer hours os mirth implores
Thy godhead to protect and hless his stores.

To thee he chants the sacred song,
‘Po thee the rich libation pours‚ fio
Thee‚ placed his household gods among,
With solemn, daily prayer adores;
So Castor and great Hercules of old '

Were with her gods by grateful Greece enroll‘d„

Gracious and good, beneath thy reign 55
May Rome her happy hours employ,

37 Augustus had either subdued or reduced to peace the
whole east, north, and west. The east is marked by Parthia;
the north by Sc thia and German ; and the west by Spain.
Dion reckons t e red·.·ction of pain, by sending colonica
thither, to be one of the happiest successes of Augustus in thie

expedition.
