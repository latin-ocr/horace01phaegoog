No idle image, Horace, of thy state. 446

Your verses too; that oil which feeds the fiame;

If ever hard was wisc, be thine the name.

SATIRE IV.

Tu: poet ridiculos one Catius, who placed the summit οἱ
. human felicity inths culinary art.

Hor-acel-1 Wmmcn comes my Catius? whither in such
aste ’.ῑ
Catius. I have no time in idle prate to waste.
1 must away to treasure in my'mind
A set os precepts, noble and refined;
Such as Pythagoras could never mach, 5
Nor Socrates, nor scienced Plato teach. ·
H. I ask your panion, and confess my crime,
To interrupt you at so cross a time.
But yet, if aught escaped through strange neglect,
You shall with ease the wisdom recollect, ιο
Whether ou boast from nature or from art
-This won rous gift os holding things hy heart.
Ο. I meant to store them total in my head,
The matter nice, and wrought of subtle thread.
H. But, prithee, catius, what’s your sage's name 3
Is he a Roman, or os foreign fame& 13
Ο. His precepts I shall willingly reveal,
And sing his doctrines, but his name conceal.
Long be your eggs, far sweeter than the round,
&fik-eg they aie, nourishing and sound. 20
