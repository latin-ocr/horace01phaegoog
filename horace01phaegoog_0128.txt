116 “ nomon.

How Jupiter numbs all the regions below,

And glazes with crystal the fleeces of snow!

Away with these humours os pride and disdain‚

To Venus ungrateful, to Cupid'a pain,

Lest, while by the pulley you raise to the top, 10

Yom‘·i rope should run back, and your bucket should
ro ,

No sprightly Tyrrhenian begot thee a prado, “

Another Penelope, harsh to be woo’d. ‘ =

Oh, though neither presents, nor vow-sighing·

obtain, ⁹

'·Noi· violet painting the cheek os thy swain, 15

Nor thy husband, who gives up his heart for a ditty
To a song-singing wench‚ can provoke thee to pity‚
Though like the hard oak you’re to sostness inclined,
And milder than all os the serpentine kind,

Yet think not this side can sor ever sustain 20
Thy threshold hard-hearted, 'and sky-falling rain.

ODE xl.—To MERCURY.

Houor: applies to Mercury to inspiro him with an ode capable
of conquering Lyde’s obstinacy.

On thou, by whose.harmonious aid,
Amphion's voice the listening stones could lead:
And sweetest shcll,‘·os power to raise,
On seven melodious stringe, thy various lays,
Not vocal, when you -first were found, ⁸ 5
Butos a simple and ungrateful sound ς*
Now tuned so sweetly tir-the ear,
That gods and men with sacred raptore hoar;
Oh! thou ins ire the melting strain

‚ ’ To charm my Ly e's obstinate disdain, lo

who, like a filly o’er the field
With playful spirit bonade, and sears to yield
To hand os gentlest touch, or prove,

Wild as she is, the joys of wedded love.
