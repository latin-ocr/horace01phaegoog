254 nomen.

For all are fools or mad, as well as you,

At least, if< w‘hat Stertinius says be true, 50
Whose wondrous preceptsl with transport heard
What time he bade me nurse this reverend heard
Cheersul from the Fabrician'bridge depart,

And with the words os comfort fill’d my beart.

For when, my fortune, lost, resolved 1 stood, 55
Oovering· my head‚'to plange into the stood, ⁸
Propitioilrzs {ie (addrpssed mev- Stprtzmas. Fnend,

ta e ee , ,
Nor wrong yourself By this unworthy deed.

, 'Tis bnt a vicione modesty te sear

Among the mad a madman to appear. 60

But listen heedsul first, while I e ain- ,¹² ,

What madness i8‚· what error os t e bram ξ’

And is in you alone ear its power, , ᾗ ·

Then bravely perish: shall say.n more. ··
Whom vieious fonies, or whom s sehood,·blind‚ 65

Are by the stoics held os maddjng kind.

All but the wise are by this process bound,

The subject natium, and the monarch crown'd,

And they, who call you fool² with equa} claim

May plead an ample title fo the name. · 70 ⁶

When in a wood we leave the tertam ways
One error sools us, though we various stray
Some to the lest, some turn to t’other side3 = '
So he, who dares thy madness to deride, ·
Though you may frankly own yonrself a roolf 76

- Behind him trails his mark os ridicule! “

For various sollies fill the human breast, · ,

As, with unreal terrers when possess’d‚

A wreteh in superstitious phrensy crieS‚

‘⁶ Lo! in the plain, fireS‚ rocks, and rivers rise Ψ 80
Α different madneSS, though-notha, inspires

The fool, who rushes wild through streams and fires 3

His mother, sister, father, hieme, and wife,

Gry out, in vain, “ Ah! yet preserve thy lise;

That headlong ditch! how dreadful it appears! 85

That hanging precipice !‘’ No more he hears,
