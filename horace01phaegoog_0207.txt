Sum) off, ye vulgar, =nor profane,

ἱ ΤΟ ΤΗΕ CHORUS OF YOUTHs AND VIRGINS. 1¹

annus taught me how to sing,
How to tune the vocal strin ;
Phoebus made me known toffame',
Honour’d with a poet’s name.
Noble youths, and virgins sair, 10
Chaste Diana's guardian care,
(Goddess, whose unerring dart
Stops the lynx, or flying hart‚)
Mark the Lesbian measures well,
Where they fall, and where they ewen, 15
And in varied cadenee sing,
As I strike the changing string.
To the god, who gilds the skies,
Let the solemn numbers rise;

Solemn sing the queen of night, 20 ·

And her crescent’s bending light,
Which adown the fruitsul year
Rolls the months in prone eareer.

ὓ 'vhe celebration of the secular games was distinguished by
the solemnity of three eat festivals, which were divided in
their institution, but by egrees became umted, and formed one
entertainment, which continued three days end three night·

mecoeaively.
