'As the majestio bird os towering kind,
Who bears the thunder through th’ ethereal space,

bird never destroyed by lightning. But this experience appears
very doubtful, and the title seems rather to be given it forits re-

Ganymede to heaven, whom the gods, as Xeno hon informs us,
tillilouggit wlff-thy of immortality for an understan 'ng and wisdom
