When Vesper lifts his ev’ning ray, ,
Or fiies the rapid bearn of day.

Not for his son the Grecian suge,
Renown'd sor thrice the morta] age:
Not for their youthful brother dead 15
Such sorrows Priam’s daughters shed.

At length these weak complaints give o’er‚
Indulge th’ unmanly grief no more,
But let us holder sweep the string,
And Cae‘sar's new-raised trophies sing3 20
The Tigris, and its freezing flood,
Euphrates, with its malms, subdued3
Whose waves are taught with humbjffls pride
Smoother to roll their lessening tide ε
The Scythiam, who reluctant yield‚ 25
Nor pour their squadrons o'er the field.
