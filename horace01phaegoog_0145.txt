The seeds of each depraved desire,

while manly toils a firmer soul inspire.
Nor knows our youth, os noblest race, 55

To mount the managed steed‚ or urge the chase;
More skill'd in the mean arts of vice,

The whirling troque, or law-forbidden dice:
And yet his worthless heir to raiae

To hasty wealth, the perjured sire betrays 60

But, while in hea his wicked wealth ascends‚
He is not of is wish possess’d‚

ODE XXV.—·ro BACCHUS.

13:1⁸0 elevated throughthe inspiration of Bacchus, the poet·-
e design isto praise Angustus.

ernn, in sacred ecstasy,
Bacchus, when full of thy divinity‚
Dost thou transport mel To what gladesl
What gloomy caverns‘, unsrequented shadesl
In what recesses shall 1 raise ⁵
My voice to sacred Caesar's deathless praise,
Amid the stars to bid him ahino,
Rank’d in the councils os the powers divinet
Some bolder song shall wake the lyre, υ
And sounds unknown its trembling strings inspiro. 10
Thus o’er the steepy mountain's height,
Starting from sleep. thy priestess takes her ssight3
Amazed‚ behold the Thracian snows‚
With languid streams where icy Heber flows3
Or Rhodope’s high-towering head, 16
