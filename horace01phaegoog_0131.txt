oDE xla—To THE FOUNTAIN BANDUSIA.⁶

Honcz promises to the fffintain 8 sacrifice, and renown from
verses.

Focum-Am, whose waters sar surpass

The shining sace os polish’d ghiso,

To thee, the gomet, crown’d with nowen,
Grateful‚ the rich libation poure ;

A goat, whose horus begin to spread, 5
And, bending, arm his ewelling head,

whose bosom glows with young desire&
Which war, or kindling love inspireS,

Now meditates his blow in vain,—

His blood shall th sair sountain stain. 10
When the fierce ogstar’s fervid ray,

Flames forth, and sets on fise the da ‚ ·

To vagi-ant nacke, that range the fie d,

You a resreshing coolness yield.

Or to the {about-wearied team, 15
Pour forth the freshness os thy stream.

Soon shalt thou flow a noble spring,

While in immortal verse I sin

The oak‚ that s reads thy roc 8 arnaud,

From whence thy babbling waters bound. 20
