Staberins thus compell'd his heirs t' engrave

On his proud tomb what legacies he gave,

Or stand condemn’d to give the crowd a feast,

By Arrius form’d in elegance of taste, 120
And gladiatorS, even 3 hundred pair,

With all the corn of Afric’s fruitful year.

A sh0e3 or is a wight‚ who hated trade3 .

The sails and tackle for 3 vessel bought

Madman or fool he might be justly thought. 15⁰
But, prithee‚ where’s the difference to behold
