228 nomer..

Not only ure from guilt, but even the shamc
That mig t with vile sus icion hurt my fame:
Nor seard'd to be reproac ’d, although my sate
Should fii my fortune in some meaner state, 110
From which some trivial perquisitos arise,
Or make me, like himself, collector os excise.
For this my heart, sar sr‘om complaining, pays
A larger debt of gratitude and praise;
Nor, while my senses hold, shall 1 repent 115
Os such a father, nor with pride resent‚
As many do, th’ involuntary disgrace
Not to be born of an illustrious racc.
But not with theirs my sentiments agree,
Or languagez for is nature should decree 120
That we from any stated point might live
Our former yearS, and to our choice should give
The sires, to whom we wish'd to be allied,
Let others choose to gratify their pride ;
While 1, contended with my own, resign 126
The titled honours os an ancient line.
This may be madness in the people‘s eyes,
But in your judgment not, perhaps, unwis03
That Ι refuse to bear a pomp of state,
Unused and much unequal to the weight. 130
· Instant a largcr fortune must be made;
'I'o purchase votes my low addresses paid3
Whether ajaunt or journey Ι propose,
With me a crowd os new companions goes3
While, anxious to complete a length of train, 135
Domestica, horses, chariots, Ι maintain.
But now, as chance or pleasure is my guide‚
Upon my bob-tail’d mule alone I ride.
Gall'd is his crupper with my wallet’s weight3
His shoulder shows his rider’s awkward seat. 140
Yet no penurious vileness e’er shall stain
M name3 as when, great pretor, with your train
Ο five poor slaves, you carry where you dine
‘Your travelling kitchen, and your flask of wine.
