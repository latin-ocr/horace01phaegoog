vineias, in public rapine bold, ω
Lollius, the just avenger, dread,
Who never by the charms os gold,
Shining seducet! was misled;
Beyond thy year such virtue shall extend,
And death alone thy consulate shall end. oo

Perpetual magistrate is he,
who keeps strict justice full in sight3
With scorn rejects th’ offender's see,
Nor weighs convenience against right3
who bids the crowd at awful distance gaze, 06
And virtue's arms victoriously displayS.

Not he, os wealth immense possess’d
Tasteless who piles his massy gold,
Among the number os the bless’d
Should have his glorious name enroll’d3 70
He better claims the glorious name who knows
With wisdom to enjoy what heaven bestows:

Who knows the wrongs os want to bear,
Even in its lowest, last extreme ;
Yet can with conscious virtue sear, 76
Far worse than death, a deed os sham03
Undaunted, sor his country or his friend
To sacrifice his lise—oh glorious end!
