Whate'er os curicus relish lay unknown
Is by Nomentane with his finger shown3
For we, poor solk‚ unknowing of our feast, 35
Eat fish and wild fowl—-of no common taste.
But he, to prove how luscious was the treat,
With a broil'd flounder's entrails crowds my plate,
Then tells me apples are more ruddy bright
Is gather’d by fair Luna's waning light. 40
He best can tell you where the differenee lies-
But here Servilius to Vibidius crieS‚
“ Sure to be poisonZd unrevenged we die,
Unless we drink the wretched miser dry.
Slave‚ g1ve us larger glasses.‘’ Struck with dread,
A fearful pale our landlord’s face o'erspread 3 46
Great were his teri-ors of such drinking solit,
Whether with too much bitterness they joke,
Or that hot wines„ dishonouring his feast,
Deafen the subtle judgment of the taste. 50
When our two champions had their faces crown’d‚
We did them justice, and the glass went round3
His parasites alone his anger fear'd,
And the full flask unwillingly they spared.
In a large dish an outstretch’d lamprey lies, 55
With shrimps all floating round: the master eries,
“ This fieb, MaecenaS‚ big with spawn was caught,
Fer after spawning-time its flesh is naught.
The sauce is mix'd with olive oil; the best,
And purest from the vats Venafran press’d, 60
And, as it boil‘d‚ we pour’d in Spanish brine,
Nor less than five-year-old Italian wine.
A little Chian‘s better when ’tis boil’d‚
By any other it is osten spoil'd.

Then was white pepper o’er it gently ur'd‚ 65
And vinegar of Lesbian vintage sour’AE0

“1 first among the men os sapience knew
Roquets and herbs in cockle brine to stew, Ι
Though in this same rich pickle, ’tis confess’d,
His unwash’d crayfish sage Curtillus dress’d.” 70
