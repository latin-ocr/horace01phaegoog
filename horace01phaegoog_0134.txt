Tun poet advises an old affigam& to her debauchery

Tuon poor man's encumbrance‚ thou rake of a wife,
At length put an end to this infamous life;
Now near thy long home, to be rank'd with the
shadea
Give over to frisk it with buxom young maida,
And, furrow’d with wrinkleS‚ profanely to shroud 5
Those bright constellations with age’s dark cloud.
What Pholoe well, with a decency free,
Might practise‚ sits awkward‚ oh Chloris, on thee.
Like her, whom the timbrel of Bacchus arouseS‚
Thy daughter may better lay siege to the houses 10
of youthsul gallantS, while she wantoply gambols;
Os Nothus enamour'd, like a goat in ¹¹²9 ramble83 '
The spindle‚ the distaff‚ and wool spinmng thrifty,
Not musical instruments‚ fit thee at fifty,
Nor roses em urpled‚ enriching the breem, 15 -
Nor hogshea s of liquor, drunk down to the lees-

On· watchsul dogs an odious ward

Might well one hapless virgin guard,

When in a tower os brass immun-ed,

And by strong gates of oak secured‚

Althou h by morta} gallants lewd 5
With affl their midnight arts purstied‚

Had not great Jove, and Venus sair

Laugh’d at her father's fruitless care,

For well they knew no sort could hold

Against a god transform’d to gold. 10
