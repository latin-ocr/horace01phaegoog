ODE XI1.-To N EOBULE.

11« this ode it is intimated that Neobule‚bein captivated hythe
love of young Hebru8‚ had given herse up to eloth.

Umrrr the maidens forbidden to prove

The humper’s full joy, or the raptures of love3

Unhappy the girls, who are destIned to hear

The tedious rebukes os old uncles severe.
Cytheraea’s wing’d son now bids thee resign 5

The toils of Minerva, the spinster divine ;

For, now, N eobule, with other desires

The brightness of Hebrus thy bosom inspire83

When he rises with vigour from Tiber's rough

waves‚

Where the oil of his labours athletio he laves, 10

Like Bellerophon skilsul to rein the fierce steed‚

At cuffs never conquer'd‚ nor outstripp’d in speed‚

And dext’rous with darts never flying in vain,

To wound the light stag, bounding over the plain,

Or active and valiant the boar to surprise, 15

Transfix'd with his spear‚ as in covert he lien.

4 Among the Romans, uncles had a greafflwer over their

nephews3 and, as they were not usual?¹ so lgent a· fathers,
theu severity passed into s proverb.— οη·
