218 ' nomos,

With printers and their shops I never deal}
No rubric pillar sets my works to sale,
O’er which the hands or vulgar readers sweat,
Or whose sost strains Tigellius can repeat.
Even by my friends compell'd 1 read my layS, 95
Nor every place, nor every audience please.
Full many bards the public forum choose‚
Where to recite the labours os their muse3 ·
Οι· vaulted baths, that best preserve the sound‚
While sweetly fioats the voice in echoes round. 100
The coxcombs never think at whose expense
They thus indulge the dear impertinence.
‘⁶ But you in libels, mischievouS, delight,
And never, but in spleen os geniu8‚ write.’'
Is there, with whom I live, who knows my beart, 105
Who taught you how to aim this venom’d dart t
He, who malignant tears an absent friend,
Or, when attack’d by others, don't desend3
Who trivial bursts of laughter strives to raise,
And courts os prating petulance the praise; · 11⁰·
Of things he never saw who tells his tale,
And friendship’s secrets knows not to conceal,
This man is vile ; here, Roman, fix your mark ;
His soul is black, as bis complexion’s dark.
At tables, crowded with a dozen guests, 11⁵
Some one shall scatter round his frigid jests‚
And only spate his host, until the bowl,
Fair friend of truth‚ unlocks his inmost soul3
Yet, though a cruel joker ou detest,
He seems a courteous, we -bred, easy guest. 12⁰
But if in idle raillery I said, “
Rufillus with persumes distracts my head,
While foul Gargonius breathes a ranker air,
You think me most envenom'd and severe.
If we, by chance, that thies Petilius name, 125
Yon, as your custom is, defend his farne.

125 The ancient commentator tells us that Petilius was gov-
ernor of the capitol, from whence he wo· called Capitolino-3
