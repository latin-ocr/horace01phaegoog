Boox 11.-sA³rinn v1.

A city meuse, and with his best
Would entertain the courtly guest.
Thrifty he wne, and full os cares

To make the most of his affaire,

Yet in the midst of his frugality
Would give a loose to hospitality.
In short, he goes», and sreely fetches

Whole ears of hoarded oats and vetches,

Dry (gl-tapes and raisins cross his chap8‚
And ainty bacon, but in scrapS,

If delicacies could invite

Who turn'd his nose at every dish,
And saucy trifled‚ with a—pish!

‘⁶ M friend, what pleasure can you find
Το ἔνθ this mountain’s back behindl
Would you prefer the town, and men,
To this wild wood‚ and dreary den,

No longer moping‚ loiter here,

But go with me to better cheer.

“ Since animals but draw their breath,
And have no being aster death3
Since nor the little, nor the eat,

Can shut the rigour os their ate

At least be mei-ry while you may,

The life of mice is but a day3

Come then, my friend, to pleasure give
The little lise you have to live.”
Encouraged thus», the country mouse,
Transponed, sallies from his house:
They both set out, in hopes to crawl
At night beneath the city wall;
