Boon v.—om: xvn. 191

Where goats untaught forsake the fiowery vale,
And bring their ewelling udders to the pail ;
Nor evening bears the sheepfold growl emund,
Nor mining vipers heave the tainted ground ; 60
Νοι· wat’ry Eurus deluges the plain,
Nor heats excessivo burn the springing grain.

Not Argo thither turn'd her armed head3
Medea there no magio poison spread3

No merchants thither plough the pathless main, 6⁵ “
-For guilty commeroe‚ and a thirst os gain3

Nor wise UlysseS, and hi‘s wandering hands,
vicione, though brave, e’er knew these happy landa.
O’er the glad flocks no foul contagion spreads‚

Nor summer sun his burning influence sheds. 70
Pure and unmix’d the world's first ages roli'd‚

But soon as brass had stain’d the flowing gold,

To iron hardened by succeeding crimes,

Jove for the just preserved these happy elimes,

To which the gods their pious raoe invite, ⁷⁵
And bid me, raptured bard, direct their ssight. ·

Ηοιιοέ. ironicall begs pardon of Canidi„ she snswers that

emm, to thy matohless art

Vanquish'd Ι yield a suppliant heart;

But oh! by hell's extended plainS,

Where Pluto's gloomy consort reigns;

By bright Diana’s vengesul tage, ⁵

Which prayer8‚ not hecatombe assuage ς

And b the bonite, of power to call

The c armed stare, and bid them fall,

No more pronounce the sacred soroll,

But back the magio circle roll. 10
Even stern Achilles could forgive

The Mysian king, and bid him live,

12 Telephus was king of Mysia. When the Greeks entered
his country, in their passage to Troy, he opposed them vigor*
