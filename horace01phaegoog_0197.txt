oDE x.—To MAEVIUS.
Hauon wishes that Maevius may suffer ehipwreck.

anr filthy Maevius hoists the spreading san,
Each luckless omen shall prevail:
Ye southern winde, invert the soamy tidem
And hang his labouring vessel's sides;
Let Eurus rouse the main with blackening roar, 5
Crack every cable, every oar;
Let the north wind rise dreadsul o'er the fioods‚ '
¹As when it breaks the mountain woods;
Nor let one friendly star shine o’er the night,
When sets Orion‘s gloomy light. 10
Mayst thou-no kinder winde, oh Maevius! meet,
Than'the victorious Grecian fleet‚
When Pallas turn'd her rage from ruin'd Troy,
The impious Ajax to destroy.
With streame os sweat the toiliug sailor glowe‚ 15
Thy face a qudypaleness shows, '
Nor shall thy villi unmanly wailings move
The pity of avenging Jove ;
While wat’ry winde the bellowing ocean shake,
I see thy luekless vessel break ς 20
But if thy careass reach the winding shore.
And birds the pamper’d prey devour,
A lamb and lustsul goat shall thank the sturm,
And 1 the sacrifice perform.
