ODE XX.—TO MAEOENAS.*
Tnpoetpromineetouaecenas afrugalentertainment.

A ron-r’s beverage‚ vile, and eheap
(Should great Maecenas be my guest‚)

Crude vintage of the Sabine grape, ,
But yet in sober cupa, shall crown the feast:

’'I'was rack’d into a Greeian cask, 5
Its rougher juiee to melt away,

1 seal’d it too—a pleasing task!
With annual joy to mark the glorious day,

When in applausivo shouts thy name

Spread from the theatro around, 10
Floatin on thy own Tiber’s stream,

And cho, playful nymph, return’d the sound.

From the Oaecubian vintage press'd
For you shall flow the racy wine 3

But ah! my meager cup’s uubless'd 15
With thel rich Formian‚ or Falernian vine.
