D. And yet you threaten’d something wondrous
grea 15

When you should warm you in your country-seat.

Why crowd the volumes of the Grecian sage,

Ranged with the writers of the comio stage3

Think you the wrath of envy to appease,

Your virtue lost in idleness and easess 20

Unhappy bard! to sure contempt you run3

Then leam the siren indolence to shun,

Or pooriy be content to lose the fame,

Which your past hours of better lise might claim.

H. Sage Damasippus, may the powers divine, 25

For this same excellent advice of thino,

Give thee a barber, in their special grace,

To 'nurse your beard, that wisdom of the face!

Yet, prithee‚ tell me whence I‘m so well known.

D. When I bad lost all business of r'ny own, 30

And at tb’ exchange my shipwreck’d fortune broke‚

1 minded the affairs of other folk.·

In rare antiquities full carious was my taste;

Here the rude chisel's rougher strokes 1 traced;

In flowing brass a vicious hardness found, 35

Or bought a statue sor five hundred pound,

A perfect connoisseur. At gainful rate,

I purchased gar-dens, or a mansion-seat.

Thus, through theccity was I known to fame,

And Mercury‘s favourite my public name. 40

H. 1 knew your illneSS, and amazed bebeld

Your sudden cure. D. A new disease expell'd

My old disorder, as when changing pains

Fly to the stomach from the head and teins.

Thus the lethargic‚ starting from his bed, 45

In boxing phrensy broke his doctor’s head.

H. Spare but this phrensy, use me as you please—

D. Good sir, don't triumph iu your own disease.

27 Our poet knows not better how to express his gratitudo
for the solemn, charitable advices, that Damasippus had given
him, than by wis ' him a good barber ; for the otoics valued
nothing so much as t ' wise and venerable length of hair.
