'rhen arm’d, alas! with horrore dire,
wide-wasting w'ith resistless ire,
Into the flames had thrown
Infante, upon whose faltering tongue
Their words in sormless accent hung, 60
Infante to life and light unknown:

 

2 But charm'd by beauty’s queen and thee,
ἱ The sire os gode, with Just decree
Assenting‚ shook the skies;
That Troy should change th’ imperial seat, 65
And guided by a better sate,
Glorious in distant realms should rise-

Oh! may the god, who could inspire
With living sounds the Grecian lym,

In Xanthus' lucid stream 70 ¹

Who joys to bathe his flowing hair,
Now make the Latian muse his care,
Γ And powerful guard her rising same!
