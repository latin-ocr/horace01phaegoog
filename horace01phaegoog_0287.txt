Boox ιι-εΑΤιΒΕ v1. 275

By mountains senced on either side,
And in my castle fortified‚
What can I write with greater pleasure 36
Thau satires in familiar measure3
Nor mad ambition there destroy8‚
Nor sickly wind my health annoys; ι
N or noxious 'autumn gives me pain,
The ruthless undertaker's gain. 40
Whatever title please thine ear,

Father of mourning, JanUS, hear,
Since mortal men by Heaven’s decree,
Commence their toils, imploring thee,
Dii-ector of the busy throng‚ 45
Be thou the preludo os my song,

At Rome, you press me: ‘⁴ Without fail;
Α friend expects you for his bail;
Be nimble to perform your part,
Lest any rival get the start. 50
Though rapid Boreas sweep the ground,
Or winter in a narrower round
Contract the day, through storin and snow,
At all adventures you must go.”

When bound beyond equivocation, 55
Or any mental reservation,
By all the ties os legal traps,
And to my ruin too, perhapS,
I still must bustle through the crowd,
And press the tard ; when aloud 60
Α foul-mouth’d sel ow reimburses
This usage with a peal os curses.
“ What madness hath possess'd thy pate
To justle folk at such a rate,
When puffing through the streete you scour 65
To meet Maecenas at an hour P'

·This pleases me, to tell the truth,
And is as honey to my tooth.
Yet when I reach th’ Esquilian hill,
(That dreadful scene, and gloomy still‚) 70
