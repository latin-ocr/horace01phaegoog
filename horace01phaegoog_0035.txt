ΟΒΕ 1v.——To SESTIUSJ*

An exhortation to pleasure, with considerations on theapproach
of, spring, and the brevity of life.

Fauen winter melts in vernal galeS,
And grateful zephyrs fill the spreading sails:
No more the ploughman loves his fire,
No more the lowing herds their stalls desire,
While earth her richest verdure yieldS, 5
Nor hoary frosts now whiten o'er the fieldS.
Now joyous through the verdant mead3‚
Beneath the rising moon, fair Venus leads
Her various dance‚ and with her train
Of nymphs and modest graces shakes the plain, 10
While Vulcan’s glowing breath inspires
The toilsome forge, and blows up all its lires,
Now crown’d with myrtle, or the flowers
Which the glad earth from her freexbosom pours,

is nothing common in the manner in which orace hat treated
it. A certain gayety of irit, under an airof seriousness, forms
its peculiar character. ven the view of death at the end of it
is a strong Epicurean reason for living as cheerfull as we can.
By the descriptione of flowers, groves, and the fes ‘vals of Ve-

nus, Faunus, and Death, which were celebrated in sprin the

ode appears to bave been written in the beginning of A tiz, but
in what year is uncertain. lt is the only one of this orm re-

the laborious employment of the usband; who is here de·
scribed working m spring, that he might forge thunderbolts
enough for Jupiter to throw in summer—Redditis. Das.

g Lo ! the queen of pleasing pains
Linking loves in mutual chains,
Wreathes, the myrtle bowers between,

Cottages of living green,
