Or pregnant bitch, or chattering Jay‚
Ill-omen‘d, guide the wicked on their way3
Serpents‚ like arrows‚ sidelong thwart 5
The road, and make their horses start.
For those I love, with anxious sear
I view the doubtful skies‚ a prudent seer;
And bid the chanting raven rise
When Phoebus gilds his orient skies; 10
Ere speeds the shower-boding crow
To lakes, whose languid waters cease to flow.
Happy may Galatea prove,
Nor yet unmindful of our love;
For now no luckless pie prevaiIS, 15 ‘
Nor vagrant crow forbids the swelling sails.
Yet see what storms tu'multuous riae,
While prone Orion sweeps the skies.
1 know the Adriatic main,
And western winde, perfidiously serene. 20
But may the rising tempest shake
Our sees, and dreadsul o‘er them break3
For them the blackening ocean rear,
And an surges lash the trembling shore.
W en on her bull Europa rode, 25
N or knew she press’d th’ imperial god,
Bold as she was, th‘ affrighted maid
The rolling monsters of the deep survey'd.
Late sor the rural nymphe she chose
Each flower, a garland to compose3 30
But now, beneath the gloom of night,
Views nought but seas, and stars of feeble light.

19 Horace knew the Adriatic sea in his voyage, ιο Athens,
when he went to study philosophy there ; and a second time in
his return to Italy, aster the battle of Philippi. ι

25 Galatea was preparing to embark, because the skies were
serene, and the seas calm3 but Horace tells her that Europa
was deceived hythe same serenity of the skies and calmness of
the seas; that she soon had reason to repentes her boldness.
when she saw nothing round her but stars and waves. such
is the force and justness of the comparison— Torr.
