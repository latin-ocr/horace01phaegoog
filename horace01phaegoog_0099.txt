Boon lte—ome xv!-

A blessing never to be sold
For geme, for purple, or for gold.
Nor ean the eonsul's power control
The sickly tumults os the sou13
Or bid the cares to stand aloof
That hover round the vaulted roos.
Happy the man, whose frugal board
His father’s plenty ean afford3 ’
His gentle sleep nor anxious sear
Shall drive away, nor sordid care.
Why do we aim with eager sti-ise
At things beyond the mark of lisel‘
To climates warm'd by, other suns
In vain the wretched exile runs;
Flies from his country’s native skies,
But never from himself he flies;
Corroding cares incessant char e
His ssight, and climb his armed arge;
Or though he mount the rapid steed‚
Care follows with unerring speed‚
Far fleeter-than the timorous hind3
Far fleeter than the driving wind.
The spirit, that, serenely gay,
Careless enjoys the present da ,
Can with an easy, cheersul smi e,
The bitterness os lise beguile;

Nor sears the approaehing bour of fate,

Nor hopes sor human bliss complete.
Achilles perish’d in his prime 3

Tithon was worn away by time 3

And fate, with lavish hand, to me

May grant what it denies to thee.

A hundred bleating flocks are thine;

Around thee graze thy lowing kine3

Neighing, thy mares invite the reins3

Thy robes the twice-died purple stains:

On me, not unindulgent fate
Bestow’d a rural‚ calm retreat,
