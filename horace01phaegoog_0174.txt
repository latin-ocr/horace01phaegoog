When fall those looks, that on thy shoulders play,

And youth's gay roeee on thy oheeks decay ς

When that smooth sace shall manhood’s roughness

Or with my wishe8‚ not my youth return‘!

ODE XL-*TO PHYLLIS.*

⁸'l'mt poet invites Phyllis thoirffideasstertainment on Maecenas'e

Pauus, 1 have a eask os wine,
Mellow'd by summere more than nine ;
With living wreaths to crown our heads
The parsley's vivid vel-dure spread83

To bind your hair the ivy twines; 5
With plate my cheerful sideboard shines ε

With vervain chaste an altar bound,

Now thirsts sor blood 3 the victim's crown’d.
All hands employed with busy haste

My boys and girls prepare our feast3 10

Trembling the pointed flames arise,

The smoke rolls upward to the skies;

But why this busy sestal care‘!

This invitation to my fair3
