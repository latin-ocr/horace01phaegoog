BORACE·

Or live luxurious in my cottage
On bacon-ham and savoury pottage!
Ο joyous nights! delicious feasts! ·
At which the gods might be my guests !''
My friends and I regaled‚ my slaves
Enjoy what their rich master leaves,
There every guest may drink and fill
As much, or little, as he will,
Exempted from the bedlam rules
Os roaring prodigals and sools:
Whether in meri-y mood or whim,
He fills his humper to the brim ;
Or, better pleased to let it pase,
Grows mellow with a moderate gIass,
Nor this man’s house, nor that’s estate
Becomes the subject os debate;
Nor whether LepOS, the buffoou
Can dame, or not, a rigadoon3
But that concerns us more, I trow,
And were a scandal not to know;
Whether our bliss coneist iu store
Os richeS, or in virtue’s lore:
Whether esteem‚ or private ends
Should guide us in the choice of friends z
Or what, is rightly understood,
Man's real mise, and sovereign good.
While thus we spend the social night,
Still mixing profit with delight,
My neighbour Cervius never fails
To club his part in pithy tales:
Suppose, Arelliu8‚ one should praiee
Your anxious opulence: he says—
A country mouse, as authors tell,
Os old invited to his cell
