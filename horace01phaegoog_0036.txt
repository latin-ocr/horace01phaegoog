24 nomon.

We'll offer, in the ehad grove, 15
Or lamb, or kid, as Pan sh best approye.

With equal pace, impartiiss fate
Knoeks at the palaea, as the cottage gate,

Nor should our sum of lise extend
Our growing hopes beyond their destined end. 20

When sunk to Pluto's shadowy coastS,
Oppress'd with darkneSS‚ and the sabled ghost8‚

No more the dice shall there assign
To thee the jovial monarehy of wine3

No more shall you the fair admire, 25
'Phe virgin's envy, and the youth's desire.

ODE V.—To PYRRHA.

Homon- describes the wretched condition of those who aro

captivated by her chen-ms, from the influence of which he hqs
escaped, as trom a shipwreck.

Wmm: liquid odours round him breathe‚

vWhat youth, the rosy bower hemath,
Now courts thee to be kindz

Pyrrha, for whose unwary heart

Do on, thus dress’d with careless art, 5
our yellow ⁴tresses bind!

How often shall th’ unpractised youth
Of alter’d godS‚ and inJured truth
With tems, alas! complain3
How soon behold with wondering eyes 10
The blaek’nin winds tempestuous riae,
And seow along the mainl

While by his easy saith betray'd,
He now enjoys thee, golden maid,

And commende her virgins gay
Thtough the mazy groves to stram—D. . “
