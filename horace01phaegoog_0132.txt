oDE x1v.-To THE ROMANS.·

Honos celebrates Augustus’s return from Spain.

Tur prince, oh Rome, who foreign realms
Explored like Jove’s immortal son,
Fearless to search the laurel wreath

By death and glorious daring won,
victorious comes from farthest Spain, 5

To Rome and all his guardian ¹gods again.

Let her, who to her arm receives
With joy her own, her lanrell’d sponse,
Her private sacrifice persorm'd, .
Pa to just Heaven her public vows, 19
And et the sair Octavia lead ¹
The matron train in suppliant veils array’d3

The matron train, to whose glad arms
Their som, with conquest crown'd, return;

And you, sair youth, whose pious tears 15
Your slaughter’d sires and husbands mourn,

ὕ Augustus lest Rome in June 727 for his British expedi-
tion3 but satisfied with the submission of that- peopb, he turned
his arms against the Spaniards, and did not return to Rome until
the ear 730. As the poet celebrated his departure, so he now
cel tates his return 3 and atter havin deacnbed the public cer-
emonies os the festival, he ends with {us enjoyment of the day

2 It is robable that the victories which Augustus gained
over the antabrians had given occasion to the poete and ora·
tors of the time to compare him to Hercules. Horace also uses n
comparison‚ which fiattery had rendered sacred, but with this
advantage, that Augustus now returns victorious to Rome, as
ger-cules formerly went toi-atium, aster his exploits in Spain.—

12 The Roman ladies usually bound their heads, as amark
of their chastity‚ with fillets, which common women duret not
wear. But Horace rather means the sacred veils‚ with which
the covered their heads and hands in sacrifices, public prayers,
a processions on extraordinary occasione—Dae.
