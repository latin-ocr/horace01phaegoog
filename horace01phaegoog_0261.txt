soon κιρ-επακ 11. 249

Her airy nest, nor was the turbot caught
Till your great pretor better precepts taught.

Tell them, that roasted cormorants are a feast,
Our docile youth obey the man of taste3 70
But sage Ofellus marks a decent mean
- A sordid, and a frugal meal between3
For a profuse expense in vain you shun
Π into sordid avarice you run.

Avidienu& who by public same 75
Was call’d “the dog,” and merited the name,

Wild cornels‚ olives five years’ old, devour’d;

Nor, tiu his wine was turn'd, his pure libatione pour‘d.
When robed in white he mark’d with sestal mirth
His day os marriage, or his hour of birth, 80
From his one bottle, os some two pouud weight‚
With oil, os execrable steneli, replete,

With his own hand he dropp’d his cabbage o'er‚

But spared his oldest vinegar no mere.

How shall the wise decide, thus urged between 85
The proverb’s ravening· wolf, and dog obscene3
Let him avoid the equal wretchedness
Of sordid filth, or prodi excess;

Nor his poor slaves lik old Albucius rate,

When he gives orders sor some curicus treat: 90
Nor yet like N aeviu& carelessly unc-lesu,

His guests with greasy water entertain.

This too is vile. Now mark, what blessings flow
From temperate meals; and first they can bestow
That prime of messinga, health: sor you'll confess 9⁶
'rhat various ments the stomach must oppress,

If you reflect how light, how well you were

When plain and simple was your cheerful sare3

But ronst, and boil’d‚ when you promiscuous eat,
When sowi and eheu-fieb in confusion meet, 100

09, We know not either Albucius or Navius, but one was
polite to affectation, the other careless to filthiness. Such m
the extremes of uarice and prodigality.
