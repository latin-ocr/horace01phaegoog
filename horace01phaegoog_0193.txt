Sooner the seas to heaven shall rise,

And earth spring upward to the skieS,

Than you not burn in' fieree desire, 95
As melts this pitch in smoky fire.’'

With rage yet doubtful what to speak‚

A midnight sury w'ill I rise:

Then shall my ghost‚ though form’d of air,
Your cheeks with crooked talons tear;
Unceasing on your entrails rey,

And sright the thoughts oss eep away: 110
Such horrors shall the guilty know ;

The vengeful crowd shall crush your bones3
Then beasts of pre and birds of air 115
Shall your unburi members tear ς
And, while they weep their favourite boy,
My parents shall the vengesul sight enjoy.”

The wolf, attaek offenee ess folk!
Turn hither, is you dare, your spite,
And bark at me, prepared to bite 3
For like a hound, or mastiff keen, 5
That guards the shepherd’s flocky green,
Thtough the deep snows Ῑ boldly chase‚
With ears erent, the savage raee;
