Who reads Lucilius with so fond an eye,
Partially fond, who can this charge denyl
But, that with wit he lash’d a vicious age, 5
He’s frankly‘praised in the same equal page.
Should I grant more, I¹may as well admit
Laberius’ sarces elegantly writ.
’Tis not enough a bursting laugh to mise,
Yet even this talent may deservo its praise: lo
concise your- diction; let your sense be clear,
Nor with a weight of words satigue the ear.
Now change from· grave to gay with ready art,
Now play the orator’s‚ or poet’s part;
In rai lery assume a gayer air, 15
Discreetly hide your strength, your vigour spare;
For ridicule shall frequently prevail,
And cut the knut, when graver reasons fail.
The ancient writers of the comic stage
Our imitation here may well engage‚ 20
Though read not by Tigellius, smooth offiano,
Or yonder ape, of horrible grimace.
CalvuS‚ Catullusbetter suit their vein,
Whose wanton son‘gs they chant in tunesul strain.
But yet a mighty seat it must be thought— 25
‘⁸ His motley page with Greek and Latin’s wrought !‘’
Blockheads ! who think it wonderful or hard,
So ost perform’d by yonder Rhodian bard.
‘⁴ But languages each other may refine,
(As Chian sostens the Falernian wine‚) 30
At least in verse.” But say, my rhyrning friend, ·
Were you that thies Petilius to defend,
While other lawyers sweated in the cause,
And urged in pure Latinity the laws:
While wondering crowds upon their language hung,
Would you, forgetful of your native tangue, 3⁰
In forei words and broken phrases speak‚
The hal -rorm'd jargon of a mongrel Greckl
ln Latium born, Ionce proposed to write
Some Grecian versicles‚ in deep of night 4⁰
