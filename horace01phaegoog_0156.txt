144 nomon.

There shall the powers os music join‚ .
And raise the song with harmony divine:
There shall the youths and virgins pay 25
To thee their grateful offerings twice a dam
Like salian priests the dance shall lead,
And many a mezy measure round thee troad.
For me, alas! those joys are o’er;
For me the vernal garland blooms no more3 30
No more the seats os wine Ι prove, ¹

. Nor the delusive hopes os mutual love.

Yet why, ah! sair one, still too deer,
Steals down my cheek th’ involuntary tearl
Or, why thus salter o’er my tongue 35
The words, which once harmonicus pour’d along!
Swist through the fields and flowing streame
1 follow thee in visionary dreams3
Now, now I seize‚ 1 clasp thy charmS,
And now you burst, ah, cruel! from my arms. 40

His pathless way, and from the venturous theme
Falling shall leave to azure sees his name.
