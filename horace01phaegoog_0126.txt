Come, then, Maecenas, and sor friendship's sake, 15
A friend preserved, a hundred humpers take.
Come drink the watchsul tapers up to-day‚
While noise and quarrels shall be sar away.
No more let Rome your anxious thoughts engage,
The Dacian falls beneath the victors' tage, 20
The Medes in civil wars their arms employ,
lngiorious wars! each other to destroy;
Our ancient soes, the haughty sons os Spain,
At length, indignant, feel the Roman chain;
With bows unbent the hardy Scythians yield‚ 25
Resolved to quit the long-disputed field.
No more the public elaims thy pious sears,
Be not too anxious then with private cares,
But seize the gists the present moment bringS,
Those fleeting gista, and leave severer things· 30

oDE ῙΧ.-ΤΟ LYDIAJ*

A Dumana between Horace and Lydia.

Horace. Wmmt Ι was pleasing to your arms
Nor any youth os happier charms
Thy snowy bosom Elisssul press'd‚
Not Persia's king like me was bless'd.

Lydia. While for no other sair you burn'd, 5
Nor Lydia was sor Chloe scorn'd,
What maid was then so bless’d as thinei
Not Ilia’s same could equal mine. “
