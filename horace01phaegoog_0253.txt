what then forbids our equal right to know
Why his own verses inharmonious ssowl 80
Or whether in his subject lies the fault,

Or in himself, that they’re not liigher wrought,
Than is the artos verse were to confine

In ten low feet a cold, dull length of line,

Content his rhyming talents to dis lay ¹ 85
In twice a hundred verses twice a ay.

Such, Cassius, thy rapidity of song,

Which like a scaming river pour’d along,

Whose volumed works (if same be not a liar)
Kindled around thy corse the funeral fire. 90

Lucilius rallies with politer ease

Than all the rhyming tribe os ancient days,

N ay more correct than him (I frankly own)

Who sorm'd this kind of verse, to Greece unknown;
Yet, were he fated to the.present age, 95
He sure had blotted the redundant page ;

Pruned all luxuriant excellence away,

.And while he labour·d·o'er th’ instructive lay ι
WouId osten scratch his head in dull despair,

And to the quick his nails bemusing tear. 100

Would you a reader’s just esteem engage,
Correct with frequent care the blotted page;

Nor strive the wonder of the crowd to raise,

But the sew better ‘udges learn to please.

Be thine, fond ma man, some vile school to choose,
Where to repeat the labours os your muse, 106
While I, like hiss'd Arbuscula unaw’d,

Despise the vulgar, since the knights applaud.

Say, shall that bug Pantilius move my'spleen ἓ
Shalll be tortured, when a wretch obscene, lis*
Or soolish FanniuS, for a sordid treat
With sweet Tigellius, shall my verses rate}

Let Plotius, VariuS, and Maecenas deign

With Virgil, Valgius, to approve my strain;

Let good Octavius even endure my lays; 115-
Let Fuscus read, and either Viscus praise ·
