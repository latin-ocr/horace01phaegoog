This day the smiling mouth divides, 1⁶
O’er which the sea-born queen presides:
Sacred to me, and due to mirth,
As the glad hour that gave me birth:
For when this happy morn appears ,
Maecenas counts a length os years 20
To roll in bright succession round,
with every J'oy and blessing crown’d.

Gay Telephus exults above
The humble fortunes of thy love;

A rich and buxom maid detains 25
‘His captive heart in willing chains.

The youth, destroy’d by heavenly fire,
Forbids ambition to aspire3 ·

And PegasuS, who scorn'd to bear ’

His earth-born rider through the' air, 30
A dread example hath supplied

To check the growth os human pride,

And cantion my presumptuous fair

To grasp at things within her s here.

Come, then, my latest love, ( or I 35
Shall never for another die,)

Come leam with me to newer lays

Thy voice os harmony to raise.

The soothing· song, ,and charming air ,
Shall lessen every gloomy care. 40

= 16 April was called the month of Venus, because her grand

Comumoss of tha spring, the Thracian winds
With kind} breath now drive the bark from shore ;
No frost, with¹ hoary'hand, the meadow binds;
Nor swoln with winter snow the torrenter-oar.
