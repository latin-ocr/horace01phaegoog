'You are not pen-jared, nor to gold a slave·;
Let Heaven your grateful sacrifice receive. ‘
But if your breast with bold ambition giows5
Set sail where hellebore abundant grows3 · ' 230
For, prithee‚ say, what difference ean you·find‚ ··
Whether to scoundrels of the vilest kind ἰ ’
You throw away your wealthin lewd exceSS,
Or know not to en‘oy what you possessi - *
When rich Oppi iuS‚ as old tales relateq 235
Το his two sons dividet} his estate, ·
Two ancient farmS‚ he called them to his bed,
And dying, thus‚with faltering accent, said :
“ In your loose robe when I have seen your bear
Your playthings‚ .A111u8‚ with an heedless·air‚- 240
Or carelesss give them to your friends away,
Or with a gantester's desperate spirit piay5
While ou, TiberiuS‚ anxious counted o'er
Your c ildish wealth‚ and hid the little store‚
A different madness seem'd to be your sate, 245
Misere or spendthrists born to imitate:
Then‚ by our household gode, my som, I charge,
That you ne’er lessen‚ that you ne’er enlarge
What seems sufficient· sor your tendet sire,

And nature’s most uhbounded wants require. · 250·

“ Thon, lest ambition tempt yn, hear this nath,

By whose eternal power 1 bind ye both ε “

Cursed be the wretchz an object of my hate,

Whoe’er accepts an office in the state. “ ,

Will you in largessesexhaust your stote, 255

That you may proudly stalk the circus o’erZ

Or in the capitol embronzed may stand,

Spoil’d of your fortune and paterual land}

And thuS, forsooth, Agrippa’s praise engage‚

Or show, with reynard’s trickS‚ the lion’s rage ?’260
Wheresore does Ajax thus unburied lie ἶ
Agamemnon. We are a king. S. A base plebeian 1,

And ask no more. A. ’Twas just what we decreed;

nutris you think it an uanghteous deed„ 264
