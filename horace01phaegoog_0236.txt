And with a smoky sorrow fill our eyes. 106
. In chariots thence at a large rate we came

Eight leaguee, and baited at a town, whose name
Cannot in verse and mensures be express’d,
But may by marks and tokene well be weesffd. 110
Its water, nature’s cheapest clement, ,

And on their shoulders to Canusium bear ;
Whose bread is gritty‚ audite wealthiest stream 115
Poor as the town's of unpoetic name.

Here Varius leaves ue, and with tears he goes:
With equal tenderness our sorrow stowe.
Onward to Rubi wearily we toil’d‚
The Journey long, the road with rain was spoil’d. 120
To Barium, samfflbffr fieb, we reach'd next day,
'Phe weather sair t much worse the way.
Then water-curs& Egnatia gave us johe,
And laughter great, to hear the moon-struck folk
Assert, is incense on their altare lay, 12⁵

The wondrous tale, which 1 e all ne’er believe;
For I have better learn'd‚ in blissful case
That the good gods enjoy immor-tal days, 130
Nor anxiously their native skiee forsake,
When miracles the lawe of nature break.
