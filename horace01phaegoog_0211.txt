Fair sun, who with unchanging beam 110
Rising another and the same,
Dost from th beamy car unsold
The g orious day,

Of light and life immortal source, 115
Mayst thou, in all thy radiant course:
Nothing more great than seven-hill’d Roine behold!

Goddess of the natal bour,
Or if other name more dear,
Propitious power, 120
Can oharm your ear,
Our pregnant matrone gracious hear3
With lenient hand their pange compone,
Heal their agonizing throes:
Give the springing birth to light, 125
And with every genial grace,
Prolific of an endless race,
Oh! crown o'ur marriage lawe, and bless tho nuptial
rite .

'rhat when the circling years complete
Again this awsul season bring, 130
Thrioe with the day’s revolving light,
Thrice beneath the shades of night,
In countless bands our youthful choirs may sing
These festal hymno, these pious gamos repeat.

Ye rates, from whom unerring flows 135
The word of truth3 whose firm deeree
Its stated bounds and order knom,
wide-spreading through eternity‚
With guardian care around us wast,
And with 'successive glories orown the atate. 140
