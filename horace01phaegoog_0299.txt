Boon 11. ——smmz vm. 287

But lo! the canopy, that o'er us spreads‚
Tumbled‚ in hideous tuin, on our headS,
With dust, how black! not such the clouds arise
When o'er the plain a northern tempest flies.
Some horrorS, yet more horrible, we dread, 75
But raise us, when we found the danger fied.
Poor Rufus droop'd his head, and sadly eried‚
As is his only son untimely died.
Sure he had wept, till weeping ne’er had end, ¹
But wiso Nomentane thus upraised his friend3 80 .
“ Fortune‚ thou oruellest of powers divine,
To joke poor moi-tals is a joke os thine.''
While Varius with a napkin searce suppress’d
His laughter, Balatro, who loves a jest,
Cries, ‘⁴ Such the lot of lise, nor must you claim, 85
For all your tons, a fair return os fame.
While you are tortured thuS, and torn with pain,
A guest like me, polite to entertain
With bread well baked, with sauees season’d right,
And all your slaves most elegantly dight, 90
Down falls the canopy, a trick of sate,
Or a groom-footman stumbling breaks a plate.
Good fortune hides, adversity calls forth
A landlord's genius, and 3 general’s worth.'’ ,
To this mine host; “ Thou ever gentle guest, 95
May all thy wishes by the gods be bless'd,
Thou best good man !’' But when we saw him rise,
From bed to bed the spreading whisper flieS.
H. Sure, never play so fine. But, prithee‚ say,
How afterward you laugh’d the time away. 100
F. ‘⁴ Slave8,” eries Vibidius», “have you broke the
cask ‘3
How osten must I call for t’other flask ¹!”
With some pretended joke our laugh was dress’d,
Servilius ever seconding the J'est,
,When you, great host, return with alter'd face, 105
As if to mend with art your late disgraee.
The slaves behind in mighty charger bore
A erano in pieces torn. and powder’d o'er
