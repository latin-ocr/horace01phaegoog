BOOK 1.——sAT1RE ιν. ’ 2'19

⁴‘ Petilius is my friend3 from early youth
Oheersul we lived together, and in truth
1 have been much indebted to his power,
And 1 rejoice to find his danger o’er. 130
But, in the name of wonder be it said,
At that same trial how he saved his head.'’
Such rancour this, of such a poisonous vein,
As never, never shall my paper stain;
Much less insect my beart, is I may dare 135
For my own heart, in anything‚ to swear.
Yet some indulgence I may justly claim,
Is too familiar with another’s same.
The best of fathers, on my youthsul breast
The detestation of a vice impress’d 140
By strong examples. Would he have me live
Conterit with what his industry could give,
In frugal, sparing sort, “ Behold, my son,
Young Albius there, how wretchedly undone!
Yet no mean lesson is the spendthrist’s sate 145
To cantion youth from squandering their estate.”
To sright me from the harlot’s vagrant bed,
‘⁶ Behold Scetanius, and his ruin dread 3⁹²
'rhat I might ne’er pursue the wedded dame,
‘⁴ A lawful Venus will indulge your fleme. 150
My son, by poor Trebonius be advised;
Sure ’tis no pleasant tale to be surprised.”

“ ’Twixt right and wrong the learned may decide,
With wise distinctions may your conduct guide;
Be mine the common wisdom, that inspires 155
The frugal manners of our ancient sires»,

And, while your mouth may yet a tutor claim,
To guard your virtue, and preserve your same,
But soon as time confirms. with stronger tone,
Your strength and mind, your conduct be your own.”

Thus did he form my youth with lenient hand; 161

When he sor virtue urged the soit command,

that he was accused of stealing a golden crown of Jupiter, and
mquitted by the favour of Augustus.
