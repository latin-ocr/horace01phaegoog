HORAC Β..

And now the night, elapsed eleven,

Possess'd the middle space of heaven,

When in a rich and splendid dome 205
They stopp'd, and found themselves at home,
Where ivory coucheS, ovet-spread

With Tyrian car-pets», glowing, fed

The dazzled eye. To lure the teste,

The fragments of a costly feast, 210
Remaining, dress'd but esterday,

In basketS, piled on bas{et3, lay.

The courtier on a purple seat

Had placed his rustic friend in state,

Then bustled, like a busy host, 215
Supplying dishes boil’d and mast,

Nor yet omits the courtier’s duty

Of tasting, ere he brings the booty.

The country meuse, with rapture strange,
Rejoices in his fair exchange, 220
And lolling, like an easy guest,

Enjoys the cheer, and cracks his jest,
When, on a sudden, opening gates,
Loud jarring, shook them from their scats·

They rau, affrighted‚ through the room, 225
And, apprehensive of their doom‚

Now trembled more and more3 when, harkl

The mastiff dogs began to bark,

The dome, to raise the tumult more,

Resouuded to the surly roar. 230
The bumpkin then concludeS, ‘⁴ Adieu!

This life, perhapS, agrees with you:

My ove, and cave, secure from suares,

Sh comfort me with chaff and tates-’⁹
