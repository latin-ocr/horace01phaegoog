The swallovv‚ hapless bird! now builds her nest, 6
And in complaining notes begins to sing,

That‚ with revenge too oruelly possess'd‚
Impious she punish’d an incestuous king.

Stretch'd on the springing grass, the shepherd swain
His reedy pipe with rural music fills: 1⁰

The god who guards his floek ap roves the strain,
The god who loves Arcadia's g oomy hills.

Vir il, ’tis thine, with noble youths to feast3

, et, since the thirsty season calls for wine,

’ Would you a cup of generous Bacchus taste, 15
Bring you the odours, and a cask is thine.

Thy little box of spikenard shall produce
A mighty oask‚ that in the cellar lies ;
1315 with large hopes shall flow th’ inspiring Juice‚
owerl‘ul to sooth our griefs, and raise our joys. 20

Is pleasures such as these ean charm thy soul,
Bring the glad merobaudise, with sweets replete;
Nor empty-handed shall you touch the bowl,
Nor do Ι mean, like wealthy solk, to treat-

Think on the gloorny pile's sunereal flames, 25
And be no more with sordid lucre blind;
Mix a short folly, that unbends the mind.
