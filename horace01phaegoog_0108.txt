Some of illustrious birth aro prend, 10 ,

Some of their clients’ vassal crowd,
And some of virtue’s fame.

, Others the rural whom-Jove,
And j0y to plant the spreading grove,
The furrow’d glebo to turm , 15
Yet with impartial hand shall sate
Both of the lowly and the great
Shake the capacious um.

Behold the match, with conscium dread,
In pointed vengeance o’or his head 20
, Who views th' impending sword3
Nor dainties force his pall'd desire,
Nor chant os birth, nor vocal lyre
'ro him can sleep afford3

Heart-soothing sleep, which not disdains 25
The run-al cot, and humble swalna,
And shady river fair3
Or Tempe's ever-blooming spring,
Where zephyrs wave the balmy mg,
And fan the buxom air. 30

Who nature’s frugal dictatos hears,

He nor the raging ocean feam,
Nor stars of power malign,

whether in gloomy storms thoy riae, ·

With angry lustre shine;

Whether his vines be emit with hailg
Whether his promised harvests fail,
