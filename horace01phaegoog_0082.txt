A slave could stern Achilles move,
And bend his haughty soul to love:
Ajax‚ invincible in arms», 5
Was eaptived by his captive's charms
Atrides, mid his triumphs mourn'd‚
And for a ravish'd virgin burn'd‚
What time the fieree barbarian bands
Fell by Pelides’ conquering hande, lo
And Troy (her Hector swept away)
Became to Greeee an easier prey.
Who knoWS. when Phyllis is your bride,
To what fine folk you’ll be allied‘l
Her parents dear‚ of gentle rane, 15
shall not their son-in-lawdisgrace.
She sprung from king3‚ or nothing lese,
And weeps the family’s dieti-ese. .
Think not, that such &chal-ming she
Can of the wretched vulgar be, 20
A maid, so faithful and so true ·
To love, to honour, and to'you.
Her dear mamma, right virtuous dame,
Could ne'er have known the blush of shame.
While thus with innoeence Ι praise‚ 25
Let me no jealous transports raise.
Heart-hold and sound 1 laud her charms,
Her face, her taper lege, her armS,
For trembling on to forty yearS,
My age forbids all jealous fearS. 30
