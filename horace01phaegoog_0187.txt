· But when the rain and snowslappean
And wint Jove loud thunders o’er the year, 30
With ounds he drives into the toils
The soaming boar, and triumphs in his spoils;
Or for the greedy thrush he lays
His nets, and with delusive baits betrays;
Artful he sets the springing snare, ‘ 35
To catch the stranger arene, or timorous hare.
, Thus happy² who would stoop to prove
The paine, the wrongS‚ and inJuries ol· lovel
But if a chaste and virtuous wife
Assist him in the tender cares os life; 40
Of'sunburnt charms‚ but honest same, · ·
(Such assthe Sabine or Apulian dame‚) ⁴
Fatigued when homeward he returnS,
The sacred fire with oheerful lustre burns;
Or if she milk her swelling kine‚ 45
Or in their'folds his happy fiocks confin03
While unbought dainties crown the feast,
And luscious wines from this year’s vintage press’d3
No more shall curious oysters please3
Or fish, the luxury of foreign seaS, ⁵0
(If eastern tem ests thundering o’er
The wint wave, s all drive them to our shore ;)*
Or wi d-fowl os delicious taste,
From distant elimatos brought to erown the feast,
Shall e’er so grateful prove to me 55
As olives gather’d from their unctuous tree,
And herbe, that love the flowery field,
And cheerful health with pure digestion yield;
Or rading, on the festal day,
Or kid just rescued from some beast os prey. 60
Amid the feast ho'w Joys he to behold
His well-'fed flocks home hasting to their sold!
