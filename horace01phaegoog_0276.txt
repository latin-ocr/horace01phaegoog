“ Sickness and health are thiae, all powerful Jove, . ·,
Then from my son this dire dise-ase remove, 406
And when your priests thy solemn fast proclaim‚
N aked the boy shall stand in Tiber’s stream.”
Should chance, or the physician's art upraise
Her infant from this desperate disease, 410
The frantie dame shall plunge her hapless boy,
Bring back the fever, and the child desti-oy.
Tell me what horrors thus have turn'd her head? “ ι
Of the good gods a superstitious dread. ³ ι,
D. These arms Stertinius gave me, our eighth sage,
That none unpunish'd may provoke my rage; 416
Who calls me mad, shall hear himself a fool,
And know he trails his mark of ridicule.
Η. Great stoic‚ so may better bargains raise
Your ruined fortune, tell me, if you please, 420
Since follies are thus various in their kind,
To what dear madness am I most inclined‘!
For I, methink8, my reasonx well maintain—
D. What! did Agave then suspect her hrain,
When by a bacchanalian phrensy led, 425
In her own hand she carried her son's head?
H. Since we must yield to truth, 'tis hermonfess'd‚
1 am a fool; with madness too possess’d;
But since my mind’s distemper’d, if you please,
What seems the proper kind of my disease'! 430
D. First that you build‚ and, scarce of two feet height,
Mimic the mighty stature of the great;
While you, forsooth, a dwarf in ὅπως, deride
His haughty spirit and gigantic stride.
Yet are you less ridiculouS, who dare, 435
Mere mimic, with Maecenas to compare.
‚It chanced‚ a mother-frog had strolled abroad‚
When a fell ox upon her young ones trod;
And only one escaped‚ who thus expressed
The doleful news—‘⁴ Ah me! a monstrous beast 440
My brothers hath destroy'd.” ‘⁶ How large ‘3” she
enee,
And ewelling forth—‘⁸ was this the monster's size 2³⁹
