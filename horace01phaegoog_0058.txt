Hono: admonishes his friend to bear with patience the death
, of Quintilius.
' Wnnmtronn restrain the tender teari
Why blush to weep for one so dear3
Sweet muse, of melting voice and lym,
Do thou the moumsul song inspire.

And Modesty, unspotted maid,
And Truth in artless guise array’d, 10

Yet all thy pious grief is vain.
In vain do you the gods implore
Thy loved Quintilius to restore 3
Whom on sar other terms they gave,
By nature sated to the grave. 20
What though you can the lyre command,
And sweep its tones with soster hand
. Than OrpheuS, whose harmonious song

make it our own, before we pretend to find a remedy for lt

uintilius in their strongest light,
