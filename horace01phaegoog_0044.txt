v ODE XL—To LEUCONOEJ*

Houcu: advises Leuconoe· to indulge in leasure‚ and to lay
aside her anxiety to pry into turity

Srnrvu· not, Leuconoe,›to pry
Into the secret will of fate,
Nor impious magio vainly try
To kuow our lives’ uncertain date ;

Whether th’ indulgent power divine ὅ
Hath many seasons yet in store,

Or this the latest winter thino,
Which breaks its waves against the shore.

Thy lise with wiser arts be crown'd,
Thy filter’d wlnes abundant pour; 10
The lengthen'd hope with prudence bound
Propertion-’d to the flying hour;

Even while we talk in careless ease,
Our envious minutes wing their flight;

Then swist the fleeting pleasure seize‚ 15
Nor trust to-morrow’s doubtful light.

ὓ This ode has much good sense init to persuade us that all
the arte os fortune-telling are a ridiculous, vain imposture, and
that true wisdom consiste in our enjoyment of the present bour,

without too much anxiety for the future—San.
1 All sciences of astrology and fortune-telling were forbidden,

and considered as impious by the heathens; but the words mean
also that impossibility of knowing the future events of life, and
the fou of tormenting ourselves to discover what is impenetra-
ble to affl our inquiries—Um.
