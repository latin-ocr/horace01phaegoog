A sheasy crown for Ceres’ head ;
Fau genial showers‚ and o'er our fleecy care 14⁵

OHORUS 01¹· Yourns Am) unome-

lf, e godS, the Roman state
as form’d by your immortal power; 155
Oris, to change th' imperial seat,
And other deities adore,
Beneath your guidance the Dardanian host
Pour²d forth their legions on the Tuscan coast3

For whom Encas, through the fire, 160
In which he saw his Troy expire,
'A passage open'd to a 113ρὲ191· elimo,
Where they might no ler triumphs gain,
And to never-ending time
With boundless empire reign. 135

Ye gods, inform our docile youth

With early principles of truth;

Ye gods, indulge the waning days

Of silver’d age with placid ease,

And grant to Rome an endless racc, 170
manure immense, and every sacred grace.
