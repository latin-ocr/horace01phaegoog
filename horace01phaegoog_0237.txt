SATIRE v1.—'ro MAECENAS.

In this satire the poet treats on true nobility.

Tironem, since the Lydians fill'd the Tuscan coms,

No richer blood than yours Etruria boasts3

Though your great ancestors have armies led,

You don't, as many do, with scorn upbraid

The man os birth unknown, or turn the nose ὅ

On me, who srorn a race οἰ slaves arose.

While you regard not from what low degree

A man‘ s descended, is his mind be sree3

Convinced, that long before th' ignoble reign

And power os TulliuS, from a servile train 10

Full many rose sor virtue high renown 'd,

By worth ennobled, and with honours crown ’dz

While he, who boasts that ancient race his own “

Which drove the haughty Tarquin from the throne,

Is vile and worthless in the poet's eyes: 1⁵

The people‚ who, you know, bestow the prize

To men most worthleSS, and, like slaves to same,

With foolish reverence hail a titled name ;

And, rapt with awo-struck admiration, gaze

When the long racc its images displays. 20
But how shall we, who differ far and wide

From the mere vulgar, this great point decide}

For ghant⁹ the crowd some high· birth’d scoundrel

c oose,

And to the low· born man os worth resuse

(Because low born) the honours os the state, 25

Shall we from thence their vice or virtue rate?

W ere 1 ex ell’d the senate-house with scorn,

J ustly, per αρε, because thus meanly born,

1 sondly wander' d from my native sphere3

Yet shall 1 with less real worth appear² ³3ss

Chain’ d to her beamy car same drags along·

The mean, the great3 an undistinguish’ d thr-nug.
Ροοι· Tillius, when compell' d· m luckless honr

To quit your purple robe and tribune' s power
